# Steely Stylite

## [Play!](https://ylliez.github.io/CART263/projects/proj01_movieNight/proj01_steelyStylite/)

Immerse yourself in the life of a 5th-century Syrian stylite using machine-learning posture detection technology!<br>
Symeon the Stylite (d. 459) was a Christian ascetic known for spending 37 years atop a pillar in religious devotion, inspiring many imitators (known as stylites from the greek word for pillar) and a few cultural actors (such as Luis Buñuel in his 1965 *Simón del desierto* from which the visual components of this game are sourced).<br>
In this game, you assume Symeon's stylitic position and must maintain your upper-body balance in the webcam to stay atop the pillar.<br>
