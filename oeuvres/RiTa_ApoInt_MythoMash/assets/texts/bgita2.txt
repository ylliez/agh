Dhritarashtra said:
What did my (people) and the Pandavas do, O
Sangaya! when they assembled together on the holy
field of Kurukshetra, desirous to do battle?
Sangaya said:
Seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battlearray, the prince Duryodhana approached his
preceptor, and spoke (these) words:
`O preceptor! observe this grand army of the sons of
Pandu, drawn up in battle-array by your talented
pupil, the son of Drupada.
In it are heroes (bearing) large bows, the equals of
Bhima and Arguna in battle (namely),
Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, the master of a great
car, and
Dhrishtaketu, Kekitana, and the valiant king of Kasi,
Purugit and Kuntibhoga, and that eminent man
Saibya;
the heroic Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaugas, the
son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi
all masters of great cars.
And now, O best of Brahmanas! learn who are most
distinguished among us, and are leaders of my
army. I will name them to you, in order that you may
know them well.
Yourself, and Bhishma, and Karna, and Kripa the
victor of (many) battles; Asvatthaman, and
Vikarna, and also the son of Somadatta,
and many other brave men, who have given up their
lives for me, who fight with various weapons,
(and are) all dexterous in battle.
Thus our army which is protected by Bhishma is
unlimited; while this army of theirs which is
protected by Bhima is very limited.
And therefore do ye all, occupying respectively the
positions I assigned to you, protect Bhishma
only.'
Then his powerful grandsire, Bhishma, the oldest of
the Kauravas, roaring aloud like a lion, blew
his conch, (thereby) affording delight to Duryodhana.
And then all at once, conchs, and kettledrums, and
tabors, and trumpets were played upon; and
there was a tumultuous din.
Then, too, Madhava and the son of Pandu
(Arguna), seated in a grand chariot to which white steeds
were yoked, blew their heavenly conchs.
Hrishikesa blew the Pankaganya, and
Dhanangaya the Devadatta, and Bhima, (the doer) of
fearful
deeds, blew the great conch Paundra.
King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew the
Anantavigaya and Nakula and Sahadeva
(respectively) the Sughosha and Manipushpaka.
And the king of Kasi, too, who has an excellent
bow, and Sikhandin, the master of a great car, and
Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and the unconquered Satyaki,
and
Drupada, and the sons of Draupadi, and the son of
Subhadra, of mighty arms, blew conchs severally
from all sides, O king of the earth!
That tumultuous din rent the hearts of all (the
people) of Dhritarashtra's (party), causing
reverberations throughout heaven and earth.
Then seeing (the people of) Dhritarashtra's party
regularly marshalled, the son of Pandu, whose
standard is the ape, raised his bow, after the discharge of
missiles had commenced, and O king of the
earth! spake these words to Hrishikesa:
`O undegraded one! station my chariot between the
two armies,
while I observe those, who stand here desirous to
engage in battle, and with whom, in the labours of
this struggle, I must do battle.
I will observe those who are assembled here and
who are about to engage in battle, wishing to do
service in battle to the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.'
Sangaya said:
Thus addressed by Gudakesa, O descendant of
Bharata! Hrishikesa stationed that excellent chariot
between the two armies, in front of Bhishma and Drona
and of all the kings of the earth,
and said: `O son of Pritha! look at these assembled
Kauravas.'
There the son of Pritha saw in both armies, fathers
and grandfathers, preceptors, maternal uncles,
brothers, sons, grandsons, companions, fathers-in-law,
as well as friends.
And seeing all those kinsmen standing (there), the
son of Kunti was overcome by excessive pity,
and spake thus despondingly.
Arguna said:
Seeing these kinsmen, O Krishna! standing (here)
anxious to engage in battle, my limbs droop
down:
my mouth is quite dried up; a tremor comes over
my body; and my hairs stand on end; the Gandiva
(bow) slips from my hand; my skin burns intensely.
I am unable, too, to stand up; my mind whirls
round, as it were; O Kesava! I see adverse omens;
and I do not perceive any good (likely to accrue)
after killing (my) kinsmen in the battle. I do not
wish for victory, O Krishna! nor sovereignty, nor
pleasures:
what is sovereignty to us, O Govinda! what
enjoyments, and even life?
Even those, for whose sake we desire sovereignty,
enjoyments, and pleasures, are standing here for
battle, abandoning life and wealth-preceptors, fathers,
sons as well as grandfathers,
maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons,
brothers-in-law, as also (other) relatives. These I do
not wish to kill, though they kill (me), O destroyer of
Madhu! even for the sake of sovereignty over the
three worlds, how much less then for this earth (alone)?
What joy shall be ours, O Ganardana! after killing
Dhritarishtra's sons?
Killing these felons we shall only incur sin.
Therefore it is not proper for us to kill our own
kinsmen, the sons of Dhritarashtra. For how, O Madhava!
shall we be happy after killing our own
relatives?
Although they have their consciences corrupted by
avarice, they do not see the evils flowing from
the extinction of a family, and the sin in treachery to
friends;
still, O Ganardana! should not we, who do see the
evils flowing from the extinction of a family,
learn to refrain from that sin?
On the extinction of a family, the eternal rites of
families are destroyed. Those rites being
destroyed, impiety predominates over the whole family.
In consequence of the predominance of impiety, O
Krishna! the women of the family become
corrupt; and the women becoming corrupt, O descendant
of Vrishni! intermingling of castes results;
that intermingling necessarily leads the family and
the destroyers of the family to hell; for when the
ceremonies of (offering) the balls of food and water (to
them) fail, their ancestors fall down (to hell).
By these transgressions of the destroyers of
families, which occasion interminglings of castes, the
eternal rites of castes and rites of families are subverted.
And O Ganardana! we have heard that men whose
family-rites are subverted, must necessarily live
in hell.
Alas! we are engaged in committing a heinous sin,
seeing that we are making efforts for killing our
own kinsmen out of greed of the pleasures of sovereignty.
If the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapon in hand, were
to kill me in battle, me being weaponless and not
defending (myself), that would be better for me.
Sangaya said:
Having spoken thus, Arguna cast asde his bow
together with the arrows, on the battle-field, and sat
down in (his) chariot, with a mind agitated by grief.
Sangaya said:
To him, who was thus overcome with pity, and
dejected, and whose eyes were full of tears and turbid,
the destroyer of Madhu spoke these words.
The Deity said:
How (comes it that) this delusion, O Arguna! which is
discarded by the good, which excludes from
heaven, and occasions infamy, has overtaken you in this
(place of) peril?
Be not effeminate, O son of Pritha! it is not worthy of
you. Cast off this base weakness of heart, and
arise, O terror of (your) foes!
Arguna said:
How, O destroyer of Madhu! shall I encounter with
arrows in battle Bhisma and Drona both, O
destroyer of enemies! entitled to reverence?
Without killing (my) preceptors (men) of great glory
it is better to live even on alms in this
world. But if killing them, though that are avaricious of
worldly goods, I should only enjoy blood-tainted
enjoyments.
Nor do we know which of the two is better for us
whether that we should vanquish them, or that
they should vanquish us. Even those, whom having
killed, we do not wish to live even thse sons of
Dhritarashtra stand (arrayed) against us.
With a heart contaminated by the taint of
helplessness, with a mind confounded about my duty, I
ask
you. Tell me what is assuredly good for me. I am your
disciple: instruct me, who have thrown myself on
your (indulgence).
For I do not perceive what is to dispel that grief
which will dry up my organs after I shall have
obtained a properous kingdom on earth without a foe, or
even the sovereignty of the gods.
Sangaya said:
Having spoken thus to Hrishikesa, O terror of (your)
foes! Gudakesa said to Govinda, `I shall not
engage in battle;' and verily remain silent.
To him thus desponding between two armies, O
descedant of Bharata! Hrishikesa spoke these
words with a slight smile.
The Deity said:
You have grieved for those who deserve no grief,
and you speak words of wisdom. Learned men
grieve not for the living nor the dead.
Never did I not exist, nor you, nor these rulers of
men; nor will any one of us ever hereafter cease to
be.
As in this body, infancy and youth and old age
(come) to the embodied (self), so does the
acquisition of another body; a sensible man is not
deceived about that.
The contacts of the senses, O son of Kunti! which
produce cold and heat, pleasure and pain, are not
permanent, they are for ever coming and going. Bear
them, O descendant of Bharata!
For, O chief of men! that sensible man whom they
afflict not, (pain and pleasure being alike to
him), he merits immortality.
There is no existence for that which is unreal; there
is no non-existence for that which is real. And
the (correct) conclusion about both is perceived by those
who perceive the truth.
Know that to be indestructible which pervades all
this; the destruction of that inexhaustible
(principle) none can bring about.
These bodies appertaining to the embodied (self)
which is eternal, indestructible, and indefinable,
are declared to be perishable; therefore do engage in
battle, O descendant of Bharata!
He who thinks one to be the killer and he who
thinks one to be killed, both know nothing. He kills
not, is not killed.
He is not born, nor does he ever die, nor, having
existed, does he exist no more.
Unborn, everlasting, unchangeable, and very
ancient, he is not killed when the body is killed. O
son of Pritha! how can that man who knows the self thus
to be indestructible, everlasting, unborn, and
imperishable, kill any one, or cause any one to be killed?
As a man, casting off old clothes, puts on others
and new ones, so the embodied (self), casting off
old bodies, goes to others and new ones.
Weapons do not divide the self (into pieces); fire
does not burn it; waters do not moisten it; the
wind does not dry it up.
It is not divisible; it is not combustible; it is not to be
moistened; it is not to be dried up. It is
everlasting, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal. It is
said to be unperceived, to be unthinkable, to be
unchangeable.
Therefore knowing it to be such, you ought not to
grieve.
But even if you think that the self is constantly born,
and constantly dies, still, O you of mighty
arms! you ought not to grieve thus.
For to one that is born, death is certain; and to one
that dies, birth is certain. Therefore about (this)
unavoidable thing, you ought not to grieve.
The source of things, O descendant of Bharata! is
unperceived; their middle state is perceived; and
their end again is unperceived. What (occasion is there
for any) lamentation regarding them?
One looks upon it as a wonder; another similarly
speaks of it as a wonder; another too hears of it as
a wonder; and even after having heard of it, no one does
really know it.
This embodied (self), O descendant of Bharata!
within every one's body is ever indestructible.
Therefore you ought not to grieve for any being.
Having regard to your own duty also, you ought not
to falter, for there is nothing better for a
Kshatriya than a righteous battle.
Happy those Kshatriyas, O son of Pritha! who can
find such a battle (to fight) come of itself
an open door to heaven!
But if you will not fight this righteous battle, then
you will have abandoned your own duty and your
fame, and you will incur sin.
All beings, too, will tell of your everlasting infamy;
and to one who has been honoured, infamy is
(a) greater (evil) than death.
(Warriors who are) masters of great cars will think
that you abstained from the battle through fear,
and having been highly thought of by them, you will fall
down to littleness.
Your enemies, too, decrying your power, will speak
much about you that should not be spoken.
And what, indeed, more lamentable than that?
Killed, you will obtain heaven; victorious, you will
enjoy the earth. Therefore arise, O son of
Kunti! resolved to (engage in) battle.
Looking on pleasure and pain, on gain and loss, on
victory and defeat as the same, prepare for
battle, and thus you will not incur sin.
The knowledge here declared to you is that relating
to the Sankhya. Now hear that relating to the
Yoga. Possessed of this knowledge, O son of Pritha! you
will cast off the bonds of action.
In this (path to final emancipation) nothing that is
commenced becomes abortive; no obstacles exist;
and even a little of this (form of) piety protects one from
great danger.
There is here O descendant of Kuru! but one state
of mind consisting in firm understanding. But
the states of mind of those who have no firm
understanding are manifold and endless.
The state of mind which consists in firm
understanding regarding steady contemplation does not
belong to those; O son of Pritha! who are strongly
attached to (worldly) pleasures and power, and whose
minds are drawn away by that flowery talk which is full of
(the ordinances of)
specific acts for the attainment of (those) pleasures
and (that) power, and which promises birth as
the fruit of acts (that flowery talk) which those unwise
ones utter,
who are enamoured of Vedic words, who say there
is nothing, else, who are full of desires, and
whose goal is heaven.
The Vedas (merely) relate to the effects of the
three qualities; do you, O Arguna! rise above those
effects of the three qualities, and be free from the pairs of
opposites, always preserve courage, be free from
anxiety for new acquisitions or protection of old
acquisitions, and be self-controlled.
To the instructed Brahmana, there is in all the
Vedas as much utility as in a reservoir of water into
which waters flow from all sides.
Your business is with action alone; not by any
means with fruit. Let not the fruit of action be your
motive (to action). Let not your attachment be (fixed) on
inaction.
Having recourse to devotion, O Dhanangaya!
perform actions, casting off (all) attachment, and
being equable in success or ill-success; (such) equability
is called devotion.
Action, O Dhanangaya! is far inferior to the
devotion of the mind.
In that devotion seek shelter. Wretched are those
whose motive (to action) is the fruit (of action).
He who has obtained devotion in this world casts off both
merit and sin. Therefore apply yourself to
devotion; devotion in (all) actions is wisdom.
The wise who have obtained devotion cast off the
fruit of action; and released from the shackles of
(repeated) births, repair to that seat where there is no
unhappiness.
When your mind shall have crossed beyond the
taint of delusion, then will you become indifferent
to all that you have heard or will hear.
When your mind, that was confounded by what you
have heard, will stand firm and steady in
contemplation, then will you acquire devotion.
Arguna said:
What are the characteristics, O Kesava! of one
whose mind is steady, and who is intent on
contemplation? How should one of a steady mind speak,
how sit, how move?
The Deity said:
When a man, O son of Pritha! abandons all the
desires of his heart, and is pleased in his self only
and by his self, he is then called of a steady mind.
He whose heart is not agitated in the midst of
calamities, who has no longing for pleasures, and
from whom (the feelings of) affection, fear, and wrath
have departed, is called a sage of a steady mind.
His mind is steady, who, being without attachments
anywhere, feels no exultation and no aversion
on encountering, the various agreeable and disagreeable
(things of this world).
A man's mind is steady, when he withdraws his
senses from (all) objects of sense, as the tortoise
(withdraws) its limbs from all sides.
Objects of sense withdraw themselves from a
person who is abstinent; not so the taste (for those
objects). But even the taste departs from him, when he
has seen the Supreme.
The boisterous senses, O son of Kunti! carry away
by force the mind even of a wise man, who exerts
himself (for final emancipation).
Restraining them, all, a man should remain
engaged in devotion, making me his only resort. For
his mind is steady whose senses are under his control.
The man who ponders over objects of sense forms
an attachment to them; from (that) attachment is
produced desire; and from desire anger is produced;
from anger results want of discrimination; from want
of discrimination, confusion of the memory;
from confusion of the memory, loss of reason; and in
consequence of loss of reason he is utterly
ruined.integrity
But the self-restrained man who moves among
objects with senses under the control of his own self,
and free from affection and aversion, obtains
tranquillity.discipline
When there is tranquillity, all his miseries are
destroyed, for the mind of him whose heart is
tranquil soon becomes steady.
He who is not self-restrained has no steadiness of
mind; nor has he who is not self-restrained
perseverance in the pursuit of self-knowledge;
there is no tranquillity for him who does not
persevere in the pursuit of self-knowledge; and whence
can there be happiness for one who is not tranquil?
For the heart which follows the rambling senses
leads away his judgment, as the wind leads a boat
astray upon the waters.
Therefore, O you of mighty arms! his mind is steady
whose senses are restrained on all sides from
objects of sense.
The self-restrained man is awake, when it is night
for all beings; and when all beings are awake,
that is the night of the right-seeing, sage.
He into whom all objects of desire enter, as waters
enter the ocean, which, (though) replenished,
(still) keeps its position unmoved, he only obtains
tranquillity; not he who desires (those) objects of
desire.
The man who, casting off all desires, lives free from
attachments, who is free from egoism, and
from (the feeling that this or that is) mine, obtains
tranquillity.
This, O son of Pritha! is the Brahmic state; attaining
to this, one is never deluded; and remaining in
it in (one's) last moments, one attains (brahma-nirvana)
the Brahmic bliss.
Arguna said:
If, O Ganardana! devotion is deemed by you to be
superior to action, then why, O Kesava! do you
prompt me to (this) fearful action?
You seem, indeed, to confuse my mind by equivocal
words. Therefore, declare one thing
determinately, by which I may attain the highest good.
The Deity said:
O sinless one! I have already declared, that in this
world there is a twofold path that of the
Sankhyas by devotion in the shape of (true) knowledge;
and that of the Yogins by devotion in the shape of
action.
A man does not attain freedom from action, merely
by not engaging in action; nor does he attain
perfection by mere renunciation.
For nobody ever remains even for an instant without
performing some action; since the qualities of
nature constrain everybody, not having free-will (in the
matter), to some action.
The deluded man who restraining the organs of
action, continues to think in his mind about objects
of sense, is called a hypocrite.
But he, O Arguna! who restraining his senses by his
mind, and being free from attachments, engages
in devotion (in the shape) of action, with the organs of
action, is far superior.
Do you perform prescribed action, for action is better
than inaction, and the support of your body,
too, cannot be accomplished with inaction.
This world is fettered by all action other than action
for the purpose of the sacrifice. Therefore, O
son of Kunti! do you, casting off attachment, perform
action for that purpose.
The Creator, having in olden times created men
together with the sacrifice, said `Propagate with
this. May it be the giver to you of the things you desire.
Please the gods with this, and may those gods
please you. Pleasing each other, you will attain the
highest good.
For pleased with the sacrifices, the gods will give
you the enjoyments you desire. And he who
enjoys himself without giving them what they have given,
is, indeed, a thief.'
The good, who eat the leavings of a sacrifice, are
released from all sins. But the unrighteous ones,
who prepare food for themselves only, incur sin.
From food are born (all) creatures; from rain is the
production of food; rain is produced by
sacrifices; sacrifices are the result of action;
know that action has its source in the Vedas; the
Vedas come from the Indestructible. Therefore the
all-comprehending Vedas are always concerned with
sacrifices.
He who in this world does not turn round the wheel
revolving thus, is of sinful life, indulging his
senses, and, O son of Pritha! lie lives in vain.
But the man who is attached to his self only, who is
contented in his self, and is pleased with his
self, has nothing to do.
He has no interest at all in what is done, and none
whatever in what is not done, in this world; nor
is any interest of his dependent on any being.
Therefore always perform action, which must be
performed, without attachment. For a man,
performing action without attachment, attains the
Supreme.
By action alone, did Ganaka and the rest work for
perfection. And having regard also to the
keeping of people (to their duties) you should perform
action.
Whatever a great man does, that other men also
do. And people follow whatever he receives as
authority.
There is nothing, O son of Pritha! for me to do in
(all) the three worlds, nothing to acquire which
has not been acquired. Still I do engage in action.
For should I at any time not engage without sloth in
action, men would follow in my path from all
sides, O son of Pritha!
If I did not perform actions, these worlds would be
destroyed, I should be the cause of casteinterminglings; and I should be ruining these people.
As the ignorant act, O descendant of Bharata! with
attachment to action, so should a wise man act
without attachment, wishing to keep the people (to their
duties).
A wise man should not shake the convictions of the
ignorant who are attached to action, but acting
with devotion (himself) should make them apply
themselves to all action.
He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks
himself the doer of the actions, which, in every way,
are done by the qualities of nature.
But he, O you of mighty arms! who knows the truth
about the difference from qualities and the
difference from actions, forms no attachments, believing
that qualities deal with qualities.
But those who are deluded by the qualities of
nature form attachments to the actions of the qualities.
A man of perfect knowledge should not shake these men
of imperfect knowledge (in their convictions).
Dedicating all actions to me with a mind knowing
the relation of the supreme and individual self,
engage in battle without desire, without (any feeling that
this or that is) mine, and without any mental
trouble.
Even those men who always act on this opinion of
mine, full of faith, and without carping, are
released from all actions.
But those who carp at my opinion and do not act
upon it, know them to be devoid of
discrimination, deluded as regards all knowledge, and
ruined.
Even a man of knowledge acts consonantly to his
own nature. All beings follow nature. What will
restraint effect?
Every sense has its affections and aversions
towards its-objects fixed. One should not become
subject to them, for they are one's opponents.
One's own duty, though defective, is better than
another's duty well performed. Death in
(performing) one's own duty is preferable ; the
(performance of the) duty of others is dangerous.
Arguna said:
But by whom, O descendant of Vrishni! is man
impelled, even though unwilling and, as it were,
constrained by force, to commit sin?
The Deity said:
It is desire, it is wrath, born from the quality of
passion; it is very ravenous, very sinful. Know that
that is the foe in this world.
As fire is enveloped by smoke, a mirror by dust, the
foetus by the womb, so is this enveloped by
desire.
Knowledge, O son of Kunti! is enveloped by this
constant foe of the man of knowledge, in the shape
of desire, which is like a fire and insatiable.
The senses, the mind, and the understanding are
said to be its seat; with these it deludes the
embodied (self) after enveloping knowledge.
Therefore `O chief of the descendants of Bharata!
first restrain your senses, then cast off this sinful
thing which destroys knowledge and experience.
It has been said, Great are the senses, greater
than the senses is the mind, greater than the mind is
the understanding. What is greater than the
understanding is that.
Thus knowing that which is higher than the
understanding, and restraining (your)self by (your)self,
O you of mighty arms! destroy this unmanageable enemy
in the shape of desire.
The Deity said:
This everlasting (system of) devotion I declared to
the sun, the sun declared it to Manu, and Manu
communicated it to Ikshvaku.
Coming thus by steps, it became known to royal
sages. But, O terror of (your) foes! that devotion
was lost to the world by long (lapse of) time.
That same primeval devotion I have declared to you
to-day, seeing that you are my devotee and
friend, for it is the highest mystery.
Arguna said:
Later is your birth; the birth of the sun is prior. How
then shall I understand that you declared (this)
first?
The Deity said:
I have passed through many births, O Arguna! and
you also. I know them all, but you, O terror of
(your) foes! do not know them.
Even though I am unborn and inexhaustible in (my)
essence, even though I am lord of all beings,
still I take up the control of my own nature, and am born
by means of my delusive power.
Whensoever, O descendant of Bharata! piety
languishes, and impiety is in the ascendant, I create
myself.
I am born age after age, for the protection of the
good, for the destruction of evil-doers, and the
establishment of piety.
Whoever truly knows thus my divine birth and work,
casts off (this) body and is not born again. He
comes to me, O Arguna!
Many from, whom affection, fear, and wrath have
departed, who are full of me, who depend on me,
and who are purified by the penance of knowledge, have
come into my essence.
I serve men in the way in which they approach me.
In every way, O son of Pritha! men follow in
my path.
Desiring the success of actions, men in this world
worship the divinities, for in this world of
mortals, the success produced by action is soon
obtained.
The fourfold division of castes was created by me
according to the apportionment of qualities and
duties. But though I am its author, know me to be
inexhaustible, and not the author.
Actions defile me not. I have no attachment to the
fruit of actions. He who knows me thus is not
tied down by actions.
Knowing this, the men of old who wished for final
emancipation, performed action. Therefore do
you, too, perform action as was done by men of old in
olden times.
Even sages are confused as to what is action, what
inaction. Therefore I will speak to you about
action, and learning that, you will be freed from (this world
of) evil.
One must possess knowledge about action; one
must also possess knowledge about prohibited
action; and again one must possess knowledge about
inaction. The truth regarding action is abstruse.
He is wise among men, he is possessed of
devotion, and performs all actions, who sees inaction in
action, and action in inaction.
The wise call him learned, whose acts are all free
from desires and fancies, and whose actions are
burnt down by the fire of knowledge.
Forsaking all attachment to the fruit of action,
always contented, dependent on none, he does
nothing at all, though he engages in action.
Devoid of expectations, restraining the mind and
the self, and casting off all belongings, he incurs
no sin, performing actions merely for the sake of the
body.
Satisfied with earnings coming spontaneously,
rising above the pairs of opposites, free from all
animosity, and equable on success or ill-success, he is
not fettered down, even though he performs
(actions).
The acts of one who is devoid of attachment, who
is free, whose mind is fixed on knowledge, and
who performs action for (the purpose of) the sacrifice are
all destroyed.
Brahman is the oblation; with Brahman (as a
sacrificial instrument) it is offered up; Brahman is in
the fire; and by Brahman it is thrown; and Brahman, too,
is the goal to which he proceeds who meditates
on Brahman in the action.
Some devotees perform the sacrifice to the gods,
some offer up the sacrifice by the sacrifice itself in
the fire of Brahman.
Others offer up the senses, such as the sense of
hearing and others, in the fires of restraint; others
offer up the objects of sense, such as sound and so forth,
into the fires of the senses.
Some again offer up all the operations of the
senses and the operations of the life-breaths into the
fire of devotion by self-restraint, kindled by knowledge.
Others perform the sacrifice of wealth, the sacrifice
of penance, the sacrifice of concentration of
mind, the sacrifice of Vedic study, and of knowledge, and
others are ascetics of rigid vows.
Some offer up the upward life-breath into the
downward life-breath, and the downward life-breath
into the upper life-breath, and stopping up the motions of
the upward and downward life-breaths, devote
themselves to the restraint of the life-breaths. Others,
who (take) limited food, offer up the life-breaths
into the life-breaths.
All of these, conversant with the sacrifice, have
their sins destroyed by the sacrifice. Those who eat
the nectar-like leavings of the sacrifice repair to the
eternal Brahman.
This world is not for those who perform no sacrifice,
whence (then) the other, O best of the
Kauravas!
Thus sacrifices of various sorts are laid down in the
Vedas. Know them all to be produced from
action, and knowing this you will be released (from the
fetters of this world).
The sacrifice of knowledge, O terror of (your) foes!
is superior to the sacrifice of wealth, for action,
O son of Pritha! is wholly and entirely comprehended in
knowledge.
That you should learn by salutation, question, and
service. The men of knowledge who perceive
the truth will teach knowledge to you.
Having learnt that, O son of Pandu! you will not
again fall thus into delusion; and by means of it,
you will see all beings, without exception, first in yourself,
and then in me.
Even if you are the most sinful of all sinful men, you
will cross over all trespasses by means of the
boat of knowledge alone.
As a fire well kindled, O Arguna! reduces fuel to
ashes, so the fire of knowledge reduces all actions
to ashes.
For there is in this world no means of sanctification
like knowledge, and that one perfected by
devotion finds within one's self in time.
He who has faith, whose senses are restrained,
and who is assiduous, obtains knowledge. Obtaining
knowledge, he acquires, without delay, the highest
tranquillity.
He who is ignorant and devoid of faith, and whose
self is full of misgivings, is ruined. Not this
world, not the next, nor happiness, is for him whose self is
full of misgivings.
Actions, O Dhanangaya! do not fetter one who is
self-possessed, who has renounced action by
devotion, and who has destroyed misgivings by
knowledge.
Therefore, O descendant of Bharata! destroy, with
the sword of knowledge, these misgivings of
yours which fill your mind, and which are produced from
ignorance. Engage in devotion. Arise!
Arguna said:
O Krishna! you praise renunciation of actions and
also the pursuit (of them). Tell me determinately
which one of these two is superior.
The Deity said:
Renunciation and pursuit of action are both
instruments of happiness. But of the two, pursuit of
action is superior to renunciation of action.
He should be understood to be always an ascetic,
who has no aversion and no desire. For, O you of
mighty arms! he who is free from the pairs of opposites is
easily released from (all) bonds.
Children not wise men talk of sankhya and yoga
as distinct. One who pursues either well
obtains the fruit of both.
The seat which the sankhyas obtain is reached by
the yogas also. He sees (truly), who sees the
sankhya and yoga as one.
Renunciation, O you of mighty arms! is difficult to
reach without devotion; the sage possessed of
devotion attains Brahman without delay.
He who is possessed of devotion, whose self is
pure, who has restrained his self, and who has
controlled his senses, and who identifies his self with
every being, is not tainted though he performs
(actions).
The man of devotion, who knows the truth, thinks he
does nothing at all, when he sees, hears,
touches, smells, eats, moves, sleeps, breathes,
talks, throws out, takes, opens or closes the eyelids;
he holds that the senses deal with the objects of
the senses.
He who, casting off (all) attachment, performs
actions dedicating them to Brahman, is not tainted
by sin, as the lotus-leaf (is not tainted) by water.
Devotees, casting off attachment, perform actions
for attaining purity of self, with the body, the
mind, the understandincy, or even the senses (all) free
(from egoistic notions).
He who is possessed of devotion, abandoning the
fruit of actions, attains the highest tranquillity.
He who is without devotion, and attached to the fruit (of
action), is tied down by (reason of his) acting in
consequence of (some) desire.
The self-restrained, embodied (self) lies at ease
within the city of nine portals, renouncing all
actions by the mind, not doing, nor causing (anything) to
be done.
The Lord is not, the cause of actions, or of the
capacity of performing actions amongst men, or of
the connexion of action and fruit. But nature only works.
The Lord receives no one's sin, nor merit either.
Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, hence all
creatures are deluded.
But to those who have destroyed that ignorance by
knowledge of the self, (such) knowledge, like the
sun, shows forth that supreme (principle).
And those whose mind is (centred) on it, whose
(very) self it is, who are thoroughly devoted to it,
and whose final goal it is, go never to return, having their
sins destroyed by knowledge.
The wise look upon a Brahmana possessed of
learning and humility, on a cow, an elephant, a dog,
and a Svapaka, as alike.
Even here, those have conquered the material
world, whose mind rests in equability; since Brahman
is free from defects and equable, therefore they rest in
Brahman.
He who knows Brahman, whose mind is steady,
who is not deluded, and who rests in Brahman,
does not exult on finding anything agreeable, nor does he
grieve on finding anything disagreeable.
One whose self is not attached to external objects,
obtains the happiness that is in (one's) self; and
by means of concentration of mind, joining one's self (with
the Brahman), one obtains indestructible
happiness.
For the enjoyments born of contact (between
senses and their objects) are, indeed, sources of misery;
they have a beginning as well as an end. O son of Kunti!
a wise man feels no pleasure in them.
He who even in this world, before his release from
the body, is able to bear the agitations produced
from desire and wrath, is a devoted man, he is a happy
man.
The devotee whose happiness is within (himself),
whose recreation is within (himself), and whose
light (of knowledge) also is within (himself), becoming
(one with) the Brahman, obtains the Brahmic
bliss.
The sages whose sins have perished, whose
misgivings are destroyed, who are self-restrained, and
who are intent on the welfare of all beings, obtain the
Brahmic bliss.
To the ascetics, who are free from desire and
wrath, and whose minds are restrained, and who have
knowledge of the self, the Brahmic bliss is on both sides
(of death).
The sage who excludes (from his mind) external
objects, (concentrates) the visual power between
the brows, and making the upward and downward lifebreaths even, confines their movements within the
nose,
who restrains senses, mind, and understanding,
whose highest goal is final emancipation, from
whom desire, fear, and wrath have departed, is, indeed,
for ever released (from birth and death).
He knowing me to be the enjoyer of all sacrifices
and penances, the great Lord of all worlds, and the
friend of all beings, attains tranquillity.
The Deity said:
He who, regardless of the fruit of actions, performs
the actions which ought to be performed, is the
devotee and renouncer; not he who discards the (sacred)
fires, nor he who performs no acts.
Know, O son of Pandu! that what is called
renunciation is devotion; for nobody becomes a devotee
who has not renounced (all) fancies.
To the sage who wishes to rise to devotion, action is
said to be a means, and to him, when be has
risen to devotion, tranquillity is said to be a means.
When one does not attach oneself to objects of
sense, nor to action, renouncing all fancies, then one
is said to have risen to devotion.
(A man) should elevate his self by his self; he should
not debase his self, for even (a man's) own self
is his friend, (a man's) own self is also his enemy.
To him who has subjugated his self by his self, his
self is a friend; but to him who has not restrained
his self, his own self behaves inimically, like an enemy.
The self of one who has subjugated his self and is
tranquil, is absolutely concentrated (on itself), in
the midst of cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as
honour and dishonour.
The devotee whose self is contented with knowledge
and experience, who is unmoved, who has
restrained his senses, and to whom a sod, a stone, and
gold are alike, is said to be devoted.
And he is esteemed highest, who thinks alike about
well-wishers, friends, and enemies, and those
who are indifferent, and those who take part with both
sides, and those who are objects of hatred, and
relatives, as well as about the good and the sinful.
A devotee should constantly devote his self to
abstraction, remaining in a secret place, alone, with
his mind and self restrained, without expectations, and
without belongings.
Fixing his seat firmly in a clean place, not too high
nor too low, and covered over with a sheet of
cloth, a deerskin, and (blades of) Kusa (grass),
and there seated on (that) seat, fixing his mind
exclusively on one point, with the workings of the
mind and senses restrained, he should practice devotion
for purity of self.
Holding his body, head, and neck even and
unmoved, (remaining) steady, looking at the tip of his
own nose, and not looking about in (all) directions,
with a tranquil self, devoid of fear, and adhering to
the rules of Brahmakarins, he should restrain
his mind, and (concentrate it) on me, and sit down
engaged in devotion, regarding me as his final goal.
Thus constantly devoting his self to abstraction, a
devotee whose mind is restrained, attains that
tranquillity which culminates in final emancipation, and
assimilation with me.
Devotion is not his, O Arguna! who eats too much,
nor his who eats not at all; not his who is
addicted to too much sleep, nor his who is (ever) awake.
That devotion which destroys (all) misery is his,
who takes due food and exercise, who toils duly in
all works, and who sleeps and awakes (in) due (time).
When (a man's) mind well restrained becomes
steady upon the self alone, then he being indifferent
to all objects of desire, is said to be devoted.
As a light standing in a windless (place) flickers not,
that is declared to be the parallel for a
devotee, whose mind is restrained, and who devotes his
self to abstraction.
That (mental condition), in which the mind
restrained by practice, of abstraction, ceases to work; in
which too, one seeing the self by the self, is pleased in
the self;
in which one experiences that infinite happiness
which transcends the senses, and which can be
grasped by the understanding only; and adhering to
which, one never swerves from the truth; acquiring
which, one thinks no other acquisition higher than it;
and adhering to which, one is not shaken off even
by great misery; that should be understood to be
called devotion in which there is a severance of all
connexion with pain.
That devotion should be practised with steadiness
and with an undesponding heart.
Abandoning, without exception, all desires, which
are produced from fancies, and restraining the
whole group of the senses on all sides by the mind only,
one should by slow steps become quiescent, with a
firm resolve coupled with courage; and fixing
the mind upon the self, should think of nothing.
Wherever the active and unsteady mind breaks
forth, there one should ever restrain it, and fix it
steadily on the self alone.
The highest happiness comes to such a devotee,
whose mind is fully tranquil, in whom the quality
of passion has been suppressed, who is free from sin,
and who is become (one with) the Brahman.
Thus constantly devoting his self to abstraction, a
devotee, freed from sin, easily obtains that
supreme happiness-contact with the Brahman.
He who has devoted his self to abstraction, by
devotion, looking alike on everything, sees the self
abiding in all beings, and all beings in the self.
To him who sees me in everything, and everything
in me, I am never lost, and he is not lost to me.
The devotee who worships me abiding in all
beings, holding that all is one, lives in me, however he
may be living.
That devotee, O Arguna! is deemed to be the best,
who looks alike on pleasure or pain, whatever it
may be, in all (creatures), comparing all with his own
(pleasure or pain).
Arguna said:
I cannot see, O destroyer of Madhu! (how) the
sustained existence (is to be secured) of this devotion
by means of equanimity which you have declared in
consequence of fickleness.
For, O Krishna! the mind is fickle, boisterous,
strong, and obstinate; and I think that to restrain it is
as difficult as (to restrain) the wind.
The Deity said:
Doubtless, O you of mighty arms! the mind is
difficult to restrain, and fickle. Still, O son of Kunti!
it may be restrained by constant practice and by
indifference (to worldly objects).
It is my belief, that devotion is hard to obtain for
one who does not restrain his self. But by one who
is self-restrained and assiduous, it can be obtained
through (proper) expedients.
Arguna, said:
What is the end of him, O Krishna! who does not
attain the consummation of his devotion, being
not assiduous, and having a mind shaken off from
devotion, (though) full of faith?
Does he, fallen from both (paths), go to ruin like a
broken cloud, being, O you of mighty arms!
without support, and deluded on the path (leading) to the
Brahman?
Be pleased, O Krishna! to entirely destroy this
doubt of mine, for none else than you can destroy
this doubt.
The Deity said:
O son of Pritha neither in this world nor the next, is
ruin for him; for, O dear friend! none who
performs good (deeds) comes to an evil end.
He who is fallen from devotion attains the worlds of
those who perform meritorious acts, dwells
(there) for many a year, and is afterwards born into a
family of holy and illustrious men.
Or he is even born into a family of talented
devotees; for such a birth as that in this world is more
difficult to obtain.
There he comes into contact with the knowledge
which belonged to him in his former body, and
then again, O descendant of Kuru! he works for
perfection.
For even though reluctant, he is led away by the
self-same former practice, and although he only
wishes to learn devotion, he rises above the (fruits of
action laid down in the) divine word.
But the devotee working with great efforts, and
cleared of his sins, attains perfection after many
births, and then reaches the supreme goal.
The devotee is esteemed higher than the
performers of penances, higher even than the men of
knowledge, and the devotee is higher than the men of
action; therefore, O Arguna! become a devotee.
And even among all devotees, he who, being full of
faith, worships me, with his inmost self intent
on me, is esteemed by me to be the most devoted.
Deity said:
O son of Pritha! now hear how you can without
doubt know me fully, fixing your mind on me, and
resting in me, and practising devotion.
I will now tell you exhaustively about knowledge
together with experience; that being known, there
is nothing further left in this world to know.
Among thousands of men, only some work for
perfection; and even of those who have reached
perfection, and who are assiduous, only some know me
truly.
Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, understanding,
and egoism, thus is my nature divided eightfold.
But this is a lower (form of my) nature. Know (that
there is) another (form of my) nature, and
higher than this, which is animate, O you of mighty arms!
and by which this universe is upheld.
Know that all things have these (for their) source. I
am the producer and the destroyer of the whole
universe.
There is nothing else, O Dhanangaya! higher than
myself; all this is woven upon me, like numbers of
pearls upon a thread.
I am the taste in water, O son of Kunti! I am the light
of the sun and moon. I am `Om' in all the
Vedas, sound in space, and manliness in human beings;
I am the fragrant smell in the earth, refulgence in the
fire; I am life in all beings, and penance in
those who perform penance.
Know me, O son of Pritha! to be the eternal seed of
all beings; I am the discernment of the
discerning ones, and I the glory of the glorious.
I am also the strength, unaccompanied by
fondness or desire, of the strong. And, O chief of the
descendants of Bharata! I am love unopposed to piety
among all beings.
And all entities which are of the quality of
goodness, and those which are of the quality of passion
and of darkness, know that they are, indeed, all from me;
I am not in them, but they are in me.
The whole universe deluded by these three states
of mind, developed from the qualities, does not
know me, who am beyond them and inexhaustible;
for this delusion of mine, developed from the
qualities, is divine and difficult to transcend. Those
who resort to me alone cross beyond this delusion.
Wicked men, doers of evil (acts), who are deluded,
who are deprived of their knowledge by (this)
delusion, and who incline to the demoniac state of mind,
do not resort to me.
But, O Arguna! doers of good (acts) of four classes
worship me: one who is distressed, one who is
seeking after knowledge, one who wants wealth, and one,
O chief of the descendants of Bharata! who is
possessed of knowledge.
Of these, he who is possessed of knowledge, who
is always devoted, and whose worship is
(addressed) to one (Being) only, is esteemed highest.
For to the man of knowledge I am dear above all
things, and he is dear to me. All these are noble.
But the man possessed of knowledge is deemed by me to
be my own self. For he with (his) self devoted to
abstraction, has taken to me as the goal than which there
is nothing higher.
At the end of many lives, the man possessed of
knowledge approaches me, (believing) that
Vasudeva is everything. Such a high-souled man is very
hard to find.
Those who are deprived of knowledge by various
desires approach other divinities, observing
various regulations, and controlled by their own natures.
Whichever form (of deity) any worshipper wishes to
worship with faith, to that form I render his
faith steady.
Possessed of that faith, he seeks to propitiate (the
deity in) that (form), and obtains from it those
beneficial things which he desires, (though they are)
really given by me.
But the fruit thus (obtained) by them, who have little
judgment, is perishable. Those who worship
the divinities go to the divinities, and my worshippers, too,
go to me.
The undiscerning ones, not knowing my
transcendent and inexhaustible essence, than which
there
is nothing higher, think me, who am unperceived, to have
become perceptible.
Surrounded by the delusion of my mystic power, I
am not manifest to all. This deluded world
knows not me unborn and inexhaustible.
I know, O Arguna! the things which have been,
those which are, and those which are to be. But me
nobody knows.
All beings, O terror of (your) foes! are deluded at
the time of birth by the delusion, O descendant of
Bharata! caused by the pairs of opposites arising from
desire and aversion.
But the men of meritorious actions, whose sins
have terminated, worship me, being released from
the delusion (caused) by the pairs of opposites, and being
firm in their beliefs.
Those who, resting on me, work for release from
old age and death, know the Brahman, the whole
Adhyitma, and all action.
And those who know me with the Adhibhuta, the
Adhidaiva, and the Adhiyagna, having minds
devoted to abstraction, know me at the time of departure
(from this world).
Arguna said:
What is that Brahman, what the Adhyatma, and
what, O best of beings! is action? And what is
called the Adhibhuta?
And who is the Adhiyagna, and how in this body, O
destroyer of Madhu? And how, too, are you to
be known at the time of departure (from this world) by
those who restrain their selfs?
The Deity said:
The Brahman is the supreme, the indestructible. Its
manifestation (as an individual self) is called the
Adhyatma. The offering (of an oblation to any divinity),
which is the cause of the production and
development of all things, is named action.
The Adhibhuta is all perishable things. The
Adhidaivata is the (primal) being. And the Adhiyagna,
O best of embodied (beings)! is I myself in this body.
And he who leaves this body and departs (from this
world) remembering me in (his) last moments,
comes into my essence. There is no doubt of that.
Also whichever form (of deity) he remembers when
he finally leaves this body, to that he goes, O son
of Kunti! having been used to ponder on it.
Therefore, at all times remember me, and engage in
battle.
Fixing your mind and understanding on me, you will
come to me, there is no doubt.
He who thinks of the supreme divine Being, O son of
Pritha! with a mind not (running) to other
(objects), and possessed of abstraction in the shape of
continuous meditation (about the supreme), goes to
him.
He who, possessed of reverence (for the supreme
Being) with a steady mind, and with the power of
devotion, properly concentrates the life-breath between
the brows, and meditates on the ancient Seer, the
ruler, more minute than the minutest atom, the supporter
of all, who is of an unthinkable form, whose
brilliance is like that of the sun, and who is beyond all
darkness, he attains to that transcendent and divine
Being.
I will tell you briefly about the seat, which those
who know the Vedas declare to be indestructible;
which is entered by ascetics from whom all desires have
departed; and wishing for which, people pursue
the mode of life of Brahmakarins.
He who leaves the body and departs (from this
world), stopping up all passages, and confining the
mind within the heart placing the life-breath in the head,
and adhering to uninterrupted meditation,
repeating the single syllable `Om,' (signifying) the
eternal Brahman, and meditating on me, he
reaches the highest goal.
To the devotee who constantly practises
abstraction, O son of Pritha! and who with a mind not
(turned) to anything else, is ever and constantly
meditating on me, I am easy of access.
The high-souled ones, who achieve the highest
perfection, attaining to me, do not again come to
life, which is transient, a home of woes.
All worlds, O Arguna! up to the world of Brahman,
are (destined) to return. But, O son of Kunti!
after attaining to me, there is no birth again.
Those who know a day of Brahman to end after
one thousand ages, and the night to terminate after
one thousand ages, are the persons who know day and
night.
On the advent of day, all perceptible things are
produced from the unperceived; and on the advent
of night they dissolve in that same (principle) called the
unperceived.
This same assemblage of entities, being produced
again and again, dissolves on the advent of night,
and, O son of Pritha! issues forth on the advent of day,
without a will of its own.
But there is another entity, unperceived and
eternal, and distinct from this unperceived (principle),
which is not destroyed when all entities are destroyed.
It is called the unperceived, the indestructible; they
call it the highest goal. Attaining to it, none
returns. That is my supreme abode.
That supreme Being, O son of Pritha! he in whom
all these entities dwell, and by whom all this is
permeated, is to be attained to by reverence not
(directed) to another.
I will state the times, O descendant of Bharata! at
which devotees departing (from this world) go,
never to return, or to return.
The fire, the flame, the day, the bright fortnight, the
six months of the northern solstice, departing
(from the world) in these, those who know the Brahman
go to the Brahman.
Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of
the southern solstice, (dying) in these, the
devotee goes to the lunar light and returns.
These two paths, bright and dark, are deemed to
be eternal in this world. By the one, (a man) goes
never to return, by the other he comes back.
Knowing these two paths, O son of Pritha! no
devotee is deluded. Therefore at all times be
possessed of devotion, O Arguna!
A devotee knowing all this, obtains all the holy fruit
which is prescribed for (study of) the Vedas,
for sacrifices, and also for penances and gifts, and he
attains to the highest and primeval seat.
Now I will speak to you, who are not given to
carping, of that most mysterious knowledge,
accompanied by experience, by knowing which you will
be released from evil.
It is the chief among the sciences, the chief among
the mysteries. It is the best means of
sanctification. It is imperishable, not opposed to the
sacred law. It is to be apprehended directly, and is
easy to practise.
O terror of your foes! those men who have no faith in
this holy doctrine, return to the path of this
mortal world, without attaining to me.
This whole universe is pervaded, by me in an
unperceived form. All entities live in me, but I, do not
live in them.
Nor yet do all entities live in me. See my divine
power. Supporting all entities and producing all
entities, my self lives not in (those) entities.
As the great and ubiquitous atmosphere always
remains in space, know that similarly all entities live
in me.
At the expiration of a Kalpa, O son of Kunti! all
entities enter my nature; and at the beginning of a
Kalpa, I again bring them forth.
Taking the control of my own nature, I bring forth
again and again this whole collection of entities,
without a will of its own, by the power of nature.
But, O Arguna! these actions do not fetter me, who
remain like one unconcerned, and who am
unattached to those actions.
Nature gives birth to movables and immovables
through me, the supervisor, and by reason of that,
O son of Kunti! the universe revolves.
Deluded people of vain hopes, vain acts, vain
knowledge, whose minds are disordered,
and who are inclined to the delusive nature of
Asuras and Rakshasas, not knowing my highest
nature as great lord of all entities, disregard me as I have
assumed a human body.
But the high-souled ones, O son of Pritha! who are
inclined to the godlike nature, knowing me as
the inexhaustible source of (all) entities, worship me with
minds not (turned) elsewhere.
Constantly glorifying me, and exerting themselves,
firm in their vows, and saluting me with
reverence, they worship me, being always devoted.
And others again, offering up the sacrifice of
knowledge, worship me as one, as distinct, and as allpervading in numerous forms.
I am the Kratu, I am the Yagna, I am the Svadha, I
the product of the herbs. I am the sacred verse.
I too am the sacrificial butter, and I the fire, I the offering.
I am the father of this universe, the mother, the
creator, the grandsire, the thing to be known, the
means of sanctification, the syllable Om, the Rik, Saman,
and Yagus also;
the goal, the sustainer, the lord, the supervisor, the
residence, the asylum, the friend, the source,
and that in which it merges, the support, the receptacle,
and the inexhaustible seed.
I cause heat and I send forth and stop showers. I
am immortality and also death; and I, O Arguna!
am that which is and that which is not.
Those who know the three (branches of)
knowledge, who drink the Soma juice, whose sins are
washed away, offer sacrifices and pray to me for a
passage into heaven; and reaching the holy world of the
lord of gods, they enjoy in the celestial regions the
celestial pleasures of the gods. And having enjoyed
that great heavenly world, they enter the mortal world
when (their) merit is exhausted.
Thus those who wish for objects of desire, and
resort to the ordinances of the three (Vedas), obtain
(as the fruit) going and coming.
To those men who worship me, meditating on me
and on no one else, and who are constantly
devoted, I give new gifts and preserve what is acquired
by them.
Even those, O son of Kunti! who being devotees of
other divinities worship with faith, worship me
only, (but) irregularly.
For I am the enjoyer as well as the lord of all
sacrifices. But they know me not truly, therefore do
they fall.
Those who make vows to the gods go to the gods;
those who make vows to the manes go to the
manes those who worship the Bhutas go to the Bhutas;
and those likewise who worship me go to me.
Whoever with devotion offers me leaf, flower, fruit,
water, that, presented with devotion, I accept
from him whose self is pure.
Whatever you do, O son of Kunti! whatever you
eat, whatever sacrifice you make, whatever you
give, whatever penance you perform, do that as offered to
me.
Thus will you be released from the bonds of action,
the fruits of which are agreeable or
disagreeable. And with your self possessed of (this)
devotion, (this) renunciation, you will be released
(from the bonds of action) and will come to me.
I am alike to all beings; to me none is hateful, none
dear. But those who worship me with devotion
(dwell) in me, and I too in them.
Even if a very ill-conducted man worships me, not
worshipping any one else, he must certainly be
deemed to be good, for he has well resolved.
He soon becomes devout of heart, and obtains
lasting tranquillity. (You may) affirm, O son of
Kunti! that my devotee is never ruined.
For, O son of Pritha! even those who are of sinful
birth, women, Vaisyas, and Sudras likewise,
resorting to me, attain the supreme goal.
What then (need be said of) holy Brahmanas and
royal saints who are (my) devotees? Coming to
this transitent unhappy world, worship me.
(Place your) mind on me, become my devotee, my
worshipper; reverence me, and thus making me
your highest goal, and devoting your self to abstraction,
you will certainly come to me.
Yet again, O you of mighty arms! listen to my
excellent words, which, out of a wish for your
welfare, I speak to you who are delighted (with them).
Not the multitudes of gods, nor the great sages
know my source; for I am in every way the origin of
the gods and great sages.
Of (all) mortals, he who knows me to be unborn,
without beginning, the great lord of the world,
being free from delusion, is released from all sins.
Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from delusion,
forgiveness, truth, restraint of the senses,
tranquillity, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear, and
also security, harmlessness, equability,
contentment, penance, (making) gifts, glory, disgrace, all
these different tempers of living beings are from
me alone.
The seven great sages, and likewise the four
ancient Manus, whose descendants are (all) these
people in the world, were all born from my mind,
(partaking) of my powers.
Whoever correctly knows these powers and
emanations of mine, becomes possessed of devotion free
from indecision; of this (there is) no doubt.
The wise, full of love, worship me, believing that I
am the origin of all, and that all moves on
through me.
(Placing their) minds on me, offering (their) lives to
me, instructing each other, and speaking about
me, they are always contented and happy.
To these, who are constantly devoted, and who
worship with love, I give that knowledge by which
they attain to me.
And remaining in their hearts, I destroy, with the
brilliant lamp of knowledge, the darkness born
of ignorance in such (men) only, out of compassion for
them.
Arguna said:
You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme goal,
the holiest of the holy.
All sages, as well as the divine sage Narada,
Asita, Devala, and Vyasa, call you the eternal being,
divine, the first god, the unborn, the all-pervading.
And so, too, you tell me yourself, O Kesava!
I believe all this that you tell me (to be) true; for, O
lord! neither the gods nor demons understand
your manifestation. You only know your self by your self.
O best of beings! creator of all things! lord of all
things! god of gods! lord of the universe! be
pleased to declare without exception your divine
emanations, by which emanations you stand pervading
all these worlds.
How shall I know you, O you of mystic power!
always meditating on you? And in what various
entities, O lord! should I meditate on you?
Again, O Ganardana! do you yourself declare your
powers and emanations; because hearing this
nectar, I (still) feel no satiety.
The Deity said:
Well then, O best of Kauravas! I will state to you
my own divine emanations; but (only) the chief
(ones), for there is no end to the extent of my
(emanations).
I am the self, O Gudakesa! seated in the hearts of
all beings. I am the beginning and the middle
and the end also of all beings.
I am Vishnu among the Adityas, the beaming sun
among the shining (bodies); I am Mariki among
the Maruts, and the moon among the lunar mansions.
Among the Vedas, I am the Sama-veda. I am
Indra among the gods. And I am mind among the
senses. I am consciousness in (living) beings.
And I am Sankara among the Rudras, the lord of
wealth among Yakshas and Rakshases. And I
am fire among the Vasus, and Meru among the hightopped (mountains).
And know me, O Arguna! to be Brihaspati, the
chief among domestic priests. I am Skanda among
generals. I am the ocean among reservoirs of water.
I am Bhrigu among the great sages. I am the
single syllable (OM) among words. Among
sacrifices I am the Gapa sacrifice; the Himalaya among
the firmly-fixed (mountains);
the Asvattha among all trees, and Narada among
divine sages; Kitraratha among the heavenly
choristers, the sage Kapila among the Siddhas.
Among horses know me to be Ukkaissravas,
brought forth by (the labours for) the nectar; and
Airavata among the great elephants, and the ruler of men
among men.
I am the thunderbolt among weapons, the wishgiving (cow) among cows. And I am love which
generates. Among serpents I am Vasuki.
Among Naga snakes I am Ananta; I am Varuna
among aquatic beings. And I am Aryaman
among the manes, and Yama among rulers.
Among demons, too, I am Pralhada. I am the king
of death (Kala, time) among those that count.
Among beasts I am the lord of beasts, and the son of
Vinata among birds.
I am the wind among those that blow. I am Rama
among those that wield weapons. Among
fishes I am Makara, and among streams the Gahnavi.
Of created things I am the beginning and the end
and the middle also, O Arguna! Among
sciences, I am the science of the Adhyatma, and I am the
argument of controversialists.
Among letters I am the letter A, and among the
group of compounds the copulative compound. I
myself am time inexhaustible, and I the creator whose
faces are in all directions.
I am death who seizes all, and the source of what
is to be. And among females, fame, fortune,
speech, memory, intellect, courage, forgiveness.
Likewise among Saman hymns, I am the Brihatsaman, and I the Gayatri among metres. I am
Margasirsha among the months, the spring among the
seasons;
of cheats, I am the game of dice; I am the glory of
the glorious; victory, I am industry, I am the
goodness of the good.
I am Vasudeva among the descendants of
Vrishni, and Arguna among the Pandavas. Among
sages also, I am Vyasa; and among the discerning ones,
I am the discerning Usanas.
I am the rod of those that restrain, and the policy
of those that desire victory. I am silence
respecting secrets. I am the knowledge of those that
have knowledge.
And, O Arguna! I am also that which is the seed
of all things. There is nothing movable or
immovable which can exist without me.
O terror of your foes! there is no end to my divine
emanations. Here I have declared the extent of
(those) emanations only in part.
Whatever thing (there is) of power, or glorious, or
splendid, know all that to be produced from
portions of my energy.
Or rather, O Arguna! what have you to do,
knowing all this at large? I stand supporting all this by
(but) a single portion (of myself).
Arguna said:
In consequence of the excellent and mysterious
words concerning the relation of the supreme and
individual soul, which you have spoken for my welfare,
this delusion of mine is gone away.
O you whose eyes are like lotus leaves! I have
heard from you at large about the production and
dissolution of things, and also about your inexhaustible
greatness.
O highest lord! what you have said about yourself
is so. I wish, O best of beings! to see your divine
form.
If, O lord! you think that it is possible for me to look
upon it, then, O lord of the possessors of
mystic power! show your inexhaustible form to me.
The Deity said:
In hundreds and in thousands see my forms, O son
of Pritha! various, divine, and of various colours
and shapes.
See the Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, the two Asvins,
and Maruts likewise. And O descendant of
Bharata! see wonders, in numbers, unseen before.
Within my body, O Gudakesa! see to-day the whole
universe, including (everything) movable and
immovable, (all) in one, and whatever else you wish to
see.
But you will not be able to see me with merely this
eye of yours. I give you an eye divine. (Now)
see my divine power.
Sangaya said:
Having spoken thus, O king! Hari, the great lord of
the possessors of mystic power, then showed to
the son of Pritha his supreme divine form,
having many mouths and eyes, having (within it)
many wonderful sights,
having many celestial ornaments, having, many
celestial weapons held erect, wearing celestial
flowers and vestments, having an anointment of celestial
perfumes, full of every wonder, the infinite deity
with faces in all directions.
If in the heavens, the lustre of a thousand suns
burst forth all at once, that would be like the lustre
of that mighty one.
There the son of Pandu then observed in the body
of the god of gods the whole universe (all) in
one, and divided into numerous (divisions).
Then Dhanangaya filled with amazement, and
with hair standing on end, bowed his head before
the god, and spoke with joined hands.
Arguna said:
O god! I see within your body the gods, as also all
the groups of various beings; and the lord
Brahman seated on (his) lotus seat, and all the sages and
celestial snakes.
I see you, who are of countless forms, possessed
of many arms, stomachs, mouths, and eyes on all
sides. And, O lord of the universe! O you of all forms! I
do not see your end or middle or beginning.
I see you bearing a coronet and a mace and a
discus a mass of glory, brilliant on all sides,
difficult to look at, having on all sides the effulgence of a
blazing fire or sun, and indefinable.
You are indestructible, the supreme one to be
known. You are the highest support of this universe.
You are the inexhaustible protector of everlasting piety. I
believe you to be the eternal being.
I see you void of beginning, middle, end of
infinite power, of unnumbered arms, having the sun
and moon for eyes, having a mouth like a blazing fire, and
heating the universe with your radiance.
For this space between heaven and earth and all
the quarters are pervaded by you alone. Looking,
at this wonderful and terrible form of yours, O high-souled
one! the three worlds are affrighted.
For here these groups of gods are entering into
you. Some being afraid are praying with joined
hands, and the groups of great sages and Siddhas are
saying `Welfare!' and praising you with abundant
(hymns) of praise.
The Rudras, and Adityas, the Vasus, the
Sadhyas, the Visvas, the two Asvins, the Maruts, and the
Ushmapas, and the groups of Gandharvas, Yakshas,
demons, and Siddhas are all looking at you amazed.
Seeing your mighty form, with many mouths and
eyes, with many arms, thighs, and feet, with
many stomachs, and fearful with many jaws, all people,
and I like-wise, are much alarmed, O you of
mighty arms!
Seeing you, O Vishnu! touching the skies, radiant,
possessed of many hues, with a gaping mouth,
and with large blazing eyes, I am much alarmed in my
inmost self, and feel no courage, no tranquillity.
And seeing your mouths terrible by the jaws, and
resembling the fire of destruction, I cannot
recognise the (various) directions, I feel no comfort. Be
gracious, O lord of gods! who pervadest the
universe.
And all these sons of Dhritarashtra, together with
all the bands of kings, and Bhishma and Drona,
and this charioteer's son likewise, together with our
principal warriors also,
are rapidly entering your mouths, fearful and
horrific by (reason of your) jaws. And some with
their heads smashed are seen (to be) stuck in the spaces
between the teeth.
As the many rapid currents of a river's waters run
towards the sea alone, so do these heroes of the
human world enter your mouths blazing all round.
As butterflies, with increased velocity, enter a
blazing fire to their destruction, so too do these
people enter your mouths with increased velocity (only) to
their destruction.
Swallowing all these people, you are licking them
over and over again from all sides, with your
blazing mouths. Your fierce splendours, O Vishnu! filling
the whole universe with (their) effulgence, are
heating it.
Tell me who you are in this fierce form.
Salutations be to thee, O chief of the gods! Be gracious. I
wish to know you, the primeval one, for I do not
understand your actions.
The Deity said:
I am death, the destroyer of the worlds, fully
developed, and I am now active about the overthrow
of the worlds. Even without you, the warriors standing in
the adverse hosts, shall all cease to be.
Therefore, be up, obtain glory, and vanquishing
(your) foes, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. All
these have been already killed by me. Be only the
instrument, O Savyasakin!
Drona, and Bhishma, and Gayadratha, and Karna,
and likewise other valiant warriors also, whom
I have killed, do you kill. Be not alarmed. Do fight. And
in the battle you will conquer (your) foes.
Sangaya said:
Hearing these words of Kesava, the wearer of the
coronet, trembling, and with joined hands,
bowed down and sorely afraid, and with throat choked up,
he again spoke to Krishna after saluting him.
Arguna said:
It is quite proper, O Hrishikesa! that the universe
is delighted and charmed by your renown, that
the demons run away affrighted in all directions, and that
all the assemblages of Siddhas bow down (to
you).
And why, O high-souled one! should they not bow
down to you (who are) greater than Brahman,
and first cause? O infinite lord of gods! O you pervading
the universe! you are the indestructible, that
which is, that which is not, and what is beyond them.
You are the primal god, the ancient being, you are
the highest support of this universe. You are
that which has knowledge, that which is the object of
knowledge, you are the highest goal. By you is this
universe pervaded, O you of infinite forms!
You are the wind, Yama, fire, Varuna, the moon,
you Pragapati, and the great grandsire.
Obeisance be to thee a thousand times, and again and
again obeisance to thee!
In front and from behind obeisance to thee!
Obeisance be to thee from all sides, O you who are
all! You are of infinite power, of unmeasured glory; you
pervade all, and therefore you are all!
Whatever I have said contemptuously, for
instance, `O Krishna!' `O Yadava!' `O friend!'
thinking you to be (my) friend, and not knowing your
greatness (as shown in) this (universal form),
or through friendliness, or incautiously; and
whatever disrespect I have shown you for purposes of
merriment, on (occasions of) play, sleep, dinner, or sitting
(together), whether alone or in the presence (of
friends), for all that, O undegraded one! I ask pardon of
you who are indefinable.
You are the father of the world movable and
immovable you its great and venerable master;
there is none equal to you, whence can there be one
greater, O you whose power is unparalleled in all the
three worlds?
Therefore I bow and prostrate myself, and would
propitiate you, the praiseworthy lord. Be
pleased, O god! to pardon (my guilt) as a father (that of
his) son, a friend (that of his) friend, or a husband
(that of his) beloved.
I am delighted at seeing what I had never seen
before, and my heart is also alarmed by fear. Show
me that same form, O god! Be gracious, O lord of gods!
O you pervading the universe!
I wish to see you bearing the coronet and the
mace, with the discus in hand, just the same (as
before). O you of thousand arms! O you of all forms!
assume that same four-handed form.
The Deity said:
O Arguna! being pleased (with you), I have by my
own mystic power shown you this supreme
form, full of glory, universal, infinite, primeval, and which
has not been seen before by any one else but
you, O you hero among the Kauravas!
I cannot be seen in this form by any one but you,
(even) by (the help of) the study of the Vedas, or
of sacrifices, nor by gifts, nor by actions, nor by fierce
penances.
Be not alarmed, be not perplexed, at seeing this
form of mine, fearful like this. Free from fear and
with delighted heart, see now again that same form of
mine.
Sangaya said:
Having thus spoken to Arguna, Vasudeva again
showed his own form, and the high-souled one
becoming again of a mild form, comforted him who had
been affrighted.
Arguna said:
O Ganardana! seeing this mild, human form of
yours, I am now in my right mind, and have come
to my normal state.
The Deity said:
Even the gods are always desiring to see this
form of mine, which it is difficult to get a sight of,
and which you have seen.
I cannot be seen, as you have seen me, by
(means of) the Vedas, not by penance, not by gift, nor
yet by sacrifice.
But, O Arguna! by devotion to me exclusively, I
can in this form be truly known, seen, and
assimilated with, O terror of your foes!
He who performs acts for (propitiating) me, to
whom I am the highest (object), who is my devotee,
who is free from attachment, and who has no enmity
towards any being, he, O son of Pandu I comes to
me.
Arguna said:
Of the worshippers, who thus, constantly devoted,
meditate on you, and those who (meditate) on the
unperceived and indestructible, which do best know
devotion?
The Deity said:
Those who being constantly devoted, and
possessed of the highest faith, worship me with a mind
fixed on me, are deemed by me to be the most devoted.
But those, who, restraining the (whole) group of the
senses, and with a mind at all times equable,
meditate on the indescribable, indestructible, unperceived
(principle) which is all-pervading, unthinkable,
indifferent,
immovable, and constant, they, intent on the good
of all beings, necessarily attain to me.
For those whose minds are attached to the
unperceived, the trouble is much greater.
Because the unperceived goal is obtained by
embodied (beings) with difficulty.
As to those, however, O son of Pritha! who,
dedicating all their actions to me, and (holding) me as
their highest (goal), worship me, meditating on me with a
devotion towards none besides me, and whose
minds are fixed on me, I, without delay, come forward as
their deliverer from the ocean of this world of
death.
Place your mind on me only; fix your understanding
on me. In me you will dwell, hereafter, (there
is) no doubt.
But if you are unable to fix your mind steadily on
me, then, O Dhanangaya! endeavour to obtain
me by the abstraction of mind (resulting) from continuous
meditation.
If you are unequal even to continuous meditation,
then let acts for (propitiating) me be your
highest (aim). Even performing actions for (propitiating)
me, you will attain perfection.
If you are unable to do even this, then resort to
devotion to me, and, with self-restraint, abandon
all fruit of action.
For knowledge is better than continuous
meditation; concentration is esteemed higher than
knowledge; and the abandonment of fruit of action than
concentration; from (that) abandonment,
tranquillity soon (results).
That devotee of mine, who hates no being, who is
friendly and compassionate, who is free from
egoism, and from (the idea that this or that is) mine, to
whom happiness and misery are alike, who is
forgiving,
contented, constantly devoted, self-restrained,
and firm in his determinations, and whose mind and
understanding are devoted to me, he is dear to me.
He through whom the world is not agitated, and
who is not agitated by the world, who is free from
joy and anger and fear and agitation, he too is dear to
me.
That devotee of mine, who is unconcerned, pure,
assiduous, impartial, free from distress, who
abandons all actions (for fruit), he is dear to me.
He who is full of devotion to me, who feels no joy
and no aversion, who does not grieve and does
not desire, who abandons (both what is) agreeable and
(what is) disagreeable, he is dear to me.
He who is alike to friend and foe, as also in
honour and dishonour, who is alike in cold and heat,
pleasure and pain, who is free from attachments,
to whom praise and blame are alike, who is
taciturn, and contented with anything whatever (that
comes), who is homeless, and of a steady mind, and full
of devotion, that man is dear to me.
But those devotees who, imbued with faith, and
(regarding) me as their highest (goal), resort to
this holy (means for attaining) immortality, as stated, they
are extremely dear to me.
The Deity said:
This body, O son of Kunti! is called Kshetra and the
learned call him who knows it the Kshetragna.
And know me also, O descendant of Bharata! to be
the Kshetragna in all Kshetras.
The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetragna is
deemed by me (to be real) knowledge. Now hear from
me in brief what that Kshetra (is), what (it is) like, what
changes (it undergoes), and whence (it comes),
and what is he, and what his powers,
(all which) is sung in various ways by sages in
numerous hymns, distinctly, and in well-settled texts
full of argument, giving indications or full instruction about
the Brahman.
The great elements, egoism, the understanding,
the unperceived also, the ten senses, and the one,
and the five objects of sense,
desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, body,
consciousness, courage, thus in brief has been declared
the
Kshetra with changes.
Absence of vanity, absence of ostentatiousness,
absence of hurtfulness, forgiveness,
straightforwardness, devotion to a preceptor, purity,
steadiness, self-restraint,
indifference towards objects of sense, and also
absence of egoism; perception of the misery and evil
of birth, death, old age, and disease;
absence of attachment, absence of self-identifying
regard for son, wife, home, and so forth; and
constant equability on the approach of (both what is)
agreeable and (what is) disagreeable;
unswerving devotion to me, without meditation on
any one else; resorting to clean places, distaste
for assemblages of men,
constancy in knowledge of the relation of the
individual self to the supreme, perception of the
object of knowledge of the truth, this is called knowledge;
that is ignorance which is opposed to this.
I will declare that which is the object of
knowledge, knowing which, one reaches immortality; the
highest Brahman, having no beginning nor end, which
cannot be said to be existent or non-existent.
It has hands and feet on all sides, it has eyes,
heads, and faces on all sides, it has ears on all sides,
it stands pervading everything in the world.
Possessed of the qualities of all the senses, (but)
devoid of all senses, unattached, it supports all, is
devoid of qualities, and the enjoyer of qualities.
It is within all things and without them; it is
movable and also immovable; it is unknowable
through (its) subtlety; it stands afar and near.
Not different in (different) things, but standing as
though different, it should be known to be the
supporter of (all) things, and that which absorbs and
creates (them).
It is the radiance even of the radiant (bodies); it is
said (to be) beyond darkness. It is knowledge,
the object of knowledge, that which is to be attained to by
knowledge, and placed in the heart of all.
Thus in brief have Kshetra, knowledge, and the
object of knowledge been declared. My devotee,
knowing this, becomes fit for assimilation with me.
Know nature and spirit both (to be) without
beginning, and know all developments and qualities
(to be) produced from nature.
Nature is said to be the origin of the capacity of
working (residing) in the body and the senses; and
spirit is said (to be) the origin of the capacity of enjoying
pleasures and pains.
For spirit with nature joined, enjoys the qualities
born of nature. And the cause of its birth in good
or evil wombs is the connexion with the qualities.
The supreme spirit in this body is called
supervisor, adviser, supporter, enjoyer, the great lord,
and
the supreme self also.
He who thus knows nature and spirit, together
with the qualities, is not born again, however
living.
Some by concentration see the self in the self by
the self; others by the Sankhya-yoga; and others
still by the Karma-yoga;
others yet, not knowing this, practise
concentration, after hearing from others. They, too, being
(thus) devoted to hearing (instruction) cross beyond
death.
Whatever thing movable or immovable comes into
existence, know that to be from the connexion
of Kshetra and Kshetragna, O chief of the descendants of
Bharata!
He sees (truly), who sees the supreme lord
abiding alike in all entities, and not destroyed though
they are destroyed.
For he who sees the lord abiding everywhere
alike, does not destroy himself by himself, and then
reaches the highest goal.
He sees (truly), who sees (all) actions (to be) in
every way done by nature alone, and likewise the
self (to be) not the doer.
When a man sees all the variety of entities as
existing in one, and (all as) emanating from that,
then he becomes (one with) the Brahman.
This inexhaustible supreme self, being without
beginning and without qualities, does not act, and
is not tainted, O son of Kunti! though stationed in the
body.
As by (reason of its) subtlety the all-pervading
space is not tainted, so the self stationed in every
body is not tainted.
As the sun singly lights up all this world, so the
Kshetragna, O descendant of Bharata! lights up
the whole Kshetra. Those who, with the eye of
knowledge, thus understand the difference between
Kshetra and Kshetragna, and the destruction of the
nature of all entities, go to the supreme.
The Deity said:
Again I will declare (to you) the highest knowledge,
the best of (all sorts of) knowledge, having
learnt which, all sages have reached perfection beyond
(the bonds of) this (body).
Those who, resorting to this knowledge, reach
assimilation with my essence, are not born at the
creation, and are not afflicted at the destruction (of the
universe).
The great Brahman is a womb for me, in which I
cast the seed. From that, O descendant of
Bharata! is the birth of all things.
Of the bodies, O son of Kunti! which are born from
all wombs, the (main) womb is the great
Brahman, and I (am) the father, the giver of the seed.
Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities born
from nature, O you of mighty arms! bind down
the inexhaustible soul in the body.
Of these, goodness, which, in consequence of
being untainted, is enlightening and free from (all)
misery, binds the soul, O sinless one! with the bond of
pleasure and the bond of knowledge.
Know that passion consists in being enamoured,
and is produced from craving and attachment.
That, O son of Kunti! binds down the embodied (self) with
the bond of action.
Darkness (you must) know to be born of ignorance,
it deludes all embodied (selfs). And that, O
descendant of Bharata! binds down (the self) with
heedlessness, indolence, and sleep.
Goodness unites (the self) with pleasure; passion,
O descendant of Bharata! with action; and
darkness with heedlessness, after shrouding up
knowledge.
Passion and darkness being repressed, goodness
stands, O descendant of Bharata! Passion and
goodness (being repressed), darkness; and likewise
darkness and goodness (being repressed), passion.
When in this body at all portals light (that is to say)
knowledge prevails, then should one know
goodness to be developed.
Avarice, activity, performance of actions, want of
tranquillity, desire, these are produced, O chief
of the descendants of Bharata! when passion is
developed.
Want of light, want of activity heedlessness, and
delusion, these are produced, O descendant of
Kuru! when darkness is developed.
When an embodied (self) encounters death, while
goodness is developed, then he reaches the
untainted worlds of those who know the highest.
Encountering death during (the prevalence of)
passion, he is born among those attached to action.
Likewise, dying during (the prevalence of) darkness, he is
born in the wombs of the ignorant.
The fruit of meritorious action is said to be good,
untainted; while the fruit of passion is misery;
and the fruit of darkness ignorance.
From goodness is produced knowledge, from
passion avarice, and from darkness heedlessness and
delusion and ignorance also.
Those who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go
up; the passionate remain in the middle; while
those of the qualities of darkness, adhering to the ways of
the lowest quality, go down.
When a right-seeing person sees none but the
qualities (to be) the doers (of all action), and knows
what is above the qualities, he enters into my essence.
The embodied (self), who transcends these three
qualities, from which bodies are produced, attains
immortality, being freed from birth and death and old age
and misery.
Arguna said:
What are the characteristics, O lord! of one who
has transcended these three qualities? What is
his conduct, and how does he transcend these three
qualities?
The Deity said:
He is said to have transcended the qualities, O
son of Pandu! who is not averse to light and activity
and delusion (when they) prevail, and who does not
desire (them when they) cease;
who sitting like one unconcerned is never
perturbed by the qualities; who remains steady and
moves not, (thinking) merely that the qualities exist; who
is self-contained;
to whom pain and pleasure are alike; to whom a
sod and a stone and gold are alike; to whom what
is agreeable and what is disagreeable are alike; who has
discernment;
to whom censure and praise of himself are alike;
who is alike in honour and dishonour; who is
alike towards the sides of friends and foes; and who
abandons all action.
And he who worships me with an unswerving
devotion, transcends these qualities, and becomes fit
for (entrance into) the essence of the Brahman.
For I am the embodiment of the Brahman, of
indefeasible immortality, of eternal piety, and of
unbroken happiness.
The Deity said:
They say the inexhaustible Asvattha has (its) roots
above, (its) branches below; the Khandas are its
leaves. He who knows it knows the Vedas.
Upwards and downwards extend its branches,
which are enlarged by the qualities, and the sprouts
of which are sensuous objects. And downwards to this
human world are continued its roots which lead on
to action.
Its form is not thus known here, nor (its) end, nor
beginning, nor support. But having with the firm
weapon of unconcern, cut this Asvattha, whose roots are
firmly fixed,
then should one seek for that seat from which
those that go there never return, (thinking) that one
rests on that same primal being, from whom the ancient
course (of worldly life) emanated.
Those who are free from pride and delusion, who
have overcome the evils of attachment, who are
constant in (contemplating) the relation of the supreme
and individual self, from whom desire has
departed, who are free from the pairs (of opposites)
called pleasure and pain, go undeluded to that
imperishable seal.
The sun does not light it, nor the moon, nor fire.
That is my highest abode, going to which none
returns.
An eternal portion of me it is, which, becoming an
individual soul in the mortal world, draws (to
itself) the senses with the mind as the sixth.
Whenever the ruler (of the bodily frame) obtains or
quits a body, he goes taking these (with him) as
the wind (takes) perfumes from (their) seats.
And presiding over the senses of hearing and
seeing and touch, and taste, and smell, and the mind,
he enjoys sensuous objects.
Those who are deluded do not see (him)
remaining in or quitting (a body), enjoying or joined to
the qualities; they see, who have eyes of knowledge.
Devotees making efforts perceive him abiding
within their selfs. But those whose selfs have not
been refined, and who have no discernment, do not
perceive him even (after) making efforts.
Know that glory (to be) mine which, dwelling in the
sun, lights up the whole world, or in the
moon or fire.
Entering the earth, I by my power support all
things, and becoming the juicy moon, I nourish all
herbs.
I becoming the fire, and dwelling in the bodies of
(all) creatures, and united with the upward and
downward life-breaths, cause digestion of the fourfold
food.
And I am placed in the heart of all; from me
(come) memory, knowledge, and their removal; I
alone am to be learnt from all the Vedas; I am the author
of the Vedantas; and I alone know the Vedas.
There are these two beings in the world, the
destructible and the indestructible. The destructible
(includes) all things. The unconcerned one is (what is)
called the indestructible.
But the being supreme is yet another, called the
highest self, who as the inexhaustible lord,
pervading the three worlds, supports (them).
And since I transcend the destructible, and since I
am higher also than the indestructible, therefore
am I celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as the best
of beings.
He who, undeluded, thus knows me the best of
beings, worships me every way, O descendant of
Bharata! knowing everything.
Thus, O sinless one! have I proclaimed this most
mysterious science. He who knows this, has
done all he need do, and he becomes possessed of
discernment.
Freedom from fear, purity of heart, perseverance in
(pursuit of) knowledge and abstraction of mind,
gifts, self-restraint, and sacrifice, study of the Vedas,
penance, straightforwardness,
harmlessness, truth, freedom from anger,
renunciation, tranquillity, freedom from the habit of
backbiting, compassion for (all) beings, freedom from
avarice, gentleness, modesty, absence of vain
activity,
noblemindedness, forgiveness, courage, purity,
freedom from a desire to injure others, absence of
vanity, (these), O descendant of Bharata! are his who is
born to godlike endowments.
Ostentatiousness, pride, vanity, anger, and also
harshness and ignorance (are) his, O son of Pritha!
who is born to demoniac endowments.
Godlike endowments are deemed to be (means) for
final emancipation, demoniac for bondage.
Grieve not, O descendant of Bharata! you are born to
god-like endowments.
(There are) two classes of created beings in this
world, the godlike and the demoniac; the godlike
(class) has been described at length; now hear from me,
O son of Pritha! about the demoniac.
Demoniac persons know not action or inaction,
neither purity nor yet (correct) conduct nor veracity
are in them.
They say the universe is devoid of truth, devoid of
fixed principle, and devoid of a ruler, produced
by union (of male and female) caused by lust, and
nothing else.
Holding this view, (these) enemies of the world, of
ruined; selfs, of little knowledge, and of
ferocious actions, are born for the destruction (of the
world).
Entertaining insatiable desire, full of vanity,
ostentatiousness, and frenzy, they adopt false notions
through delusion, and engage in unholy observances.
Indulging in boundless thoughts ending with
death, given up to the enjoyment of objects of desire,
being resolved that that is all,
bound down by nets of hopes in hundreds, given
up to anger and desire, they wish to obtain heaps
of wealth unfairly for enjoying objects of desire.
`This have I obtained to-day; this wish I will obtain;
this wealth is mine; and this also shall be
mine;
this foe I have killed; others too I will destroy; I am
lord, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, strong,
happy;
I have wealth; I am of noble birth; who else is like
me? I will sacrifice; I will make gifts; I will
rejoice.' Thus deluded by ignorance,
tossed about by numerous thoughts, surrounded
by the net of delusion, and attached to the
enjoyment of objects of desire, they fall down into impure
hell.
Honoured (only) by themselves, void of humility,
and full of the pride and frenzy of wealth, these
calumniators; (of the virtuous) perform sacrifices, which
are sacrifices only in name, with ostentatiousness
and against prescribed rules;
indulging (their) vanity, brute force, arrogance,
lust, and anger; and hating me in their own bodies
and in those of others.
These enemies, ferocious, meanest of men, and
unholy, I continually hurl down to these worlds,
only into demoniac wombs.
Coming into demoniac wombs, deluded in every
birth, they go down to the vilest state, O son of
Kunti! without ever coming to me.
Threefold is this way to hell, ruinous to the self,
lust, anger, and likewise avarice; therefore
one should abandon this triad.
Released from these three ways to darkness, O
son of Kunti! a man works out his own salvation,
and then proceeds to the highest goal.
He who abandoning scripture ordinances, acts
under the impulse of desire, does not attain
perfection, nor happiness, nor the highest goal.
Therefore in discriminating between what should
be done and what should not be done, your
authority (must be) scripture. And knowing what is
declared by the ordinances of scripture, you should
perform action in this world.
Arguna said:
What is the state of those, O Krishna! who worship
with faith, (but) abandoning scripture
ordinances goodness, passion, or darkness?
The Deity said:
Faith is of three kinds in embodied (beings), it is
produced from dispositions. It is of the quality of
goodness, of the quality of passion, and of the quality of
darkness. Hear about it.
The faith of all, O descendant of Bharata! is
conformable to the heart. A being here is full of faith,
and whatever is a man's faith, that is a man himself.
Those of the quality of goodness worship the gods;
those of the quality of passion the Yakshas and
Rakshases; and the others, the people of the quality of
darkness, worship departed (spirits) and the
multitudes of Bhutas.
Know those to-be of demoniac convictions, who
practise fierce penance not ordained by scripture;
who are full of ostentatiousness and egoism, and of
desire, attachment, and stubbornness; who are without
discernment;
and who torment the groups of organs in (their)
bodies, and me also seated within (those) bodies.
The food also, which is liked by all, and likewise the
sacrifice, the penance, and gifts, are of three
kinds. Listen to the distinctions regarding them as
follows.
The kinds of food which increase life, energy,
strength, health, comfort, and relish, which are
savoury, oleaginous, full of nutrition, and agreeable, are
liked by the good.
The kinds of food which are bitter, acid, saltish, too
hot, sharp, rough, and burning, and which
cause pain, grief, and disease, are desired by the
passionate.
And the food which is cold, tasteless, stinking,
stale, impure, and even leavings, are liked by the
dark.
That sacrifice is good which, being prescribed in
(scripture) ordinances, is performed by persons
not wishing for the fruit (of it), and after determining (in
their) mind that the sacrifice must needs be
performed.
But when a sacrifice is performed, O highest of
the descendants of Bharata! with an expectation of
fruit (from it), and for the purpose of ostentation, know
that sacrifice (to be) passionate.
They call that sacrifice dark, which is against the
ordinances (of scripture), in which no food is
dealt out (to Brahmanas, &c.), which is devoid of Mantras,
devoid of Dakshina presents, and which is
without faith.
Paying reverence to gods, Brahmanas,
preceptors, and men of knowledge; purity,
straightforwardness, life as Brahmakarin, and
harmlessness, (this) is called the penance bodily.
The speech which causes no sorrow, which is
true, agreeable, and beneficial, and the study of the
Vedas, (this) is called the penance vocal.
Calmness of mind, mildness, taciturnity, selfrestraint, and purity of heart, this is called the
penance mental.
This threefold penance, practised with perfect
faith, by men who do not wish for the fruit, and who
are possessed of devotion, is called good.
The penance which is done for respect, honour,
and reverence, and with ostentatiousness, and
which is uncertain and transient, is here called
passionate.
And that penance is described as dark, which is
performed under a misguided conviction, with
pain to oneself, or for the destruction of another.
That gift is said (to be) good, which is given,
because it ought to be given, to one who (can) do no
service (in return), at a (proper) place and time, and to a
(proper) person.
But that gift which is given with much difficulty, for
a return of services, or even with an
expectation of fruit, is said to be passionate.
And that gift is described as dark, which is given
to unfit persons, at an unfit place and time,
without respect, and with contempt.
Om, Tad, and Sat, this is said (to be) the threefold
designation of the Brahman. By that, the
Brahmanas and the Vedas and sacrifices were created in
olden times.
Hence, the performance by those who study the
Brahman, of sacrifices, gifts, and penances,
prescribed by the ordinances (of scripture, always
commence after saying `Om.'
Those who desire final emancipation perform the
various acts of sacrifice and penance, and the
various acts of gift, without expectation of fruit, after
(saying) `Tad.'
`Sat' is employed to express existence and
goodness; and likewise, O son of Pritha! the word `Sat'
is used to express an auspicious act.
Constancy in (making) sacrifices, penances, and
gifts, is called `Sat'; and (all) action, too, of
which that is the object, is also called `Sat.'
Whatever oblation is offered, whatever is given,
whatever penance is performed, and whatever is
done, without faith, that, O son of Pritha! is called `Asat,'
and that is nought, both after death and here.
Arguna said:
O you of mighty arms! O Hrishikesa! O destroyer
of Kesin! I wish to know the truth about
renunciation and abandonment distinctly.
The Deity said:
By renunciation the sages understand the rejection
of actions done with desires. The wise call the
abandonment of the fruit of all actions (by the name)
abandonment.
Some wise men say, that action should be
abandoned as being full of evil; and others, that the
actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should not be
abandoned.
As to that abandonment, O best of the descendants
of Bharata! listen to my decision; for
abandonment, O bravest of men! is described (to be)
threefold.
The actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should
not be abandoned; they must needs be performed;
for sacrifices, gifts, and penances are means of
sanctification to the wise.
But even these actions, O son of Pritha! should be
performed, abandoning attachment and fruit;
such is my excellent and decided opinion.
The renunciation of prescribed action is not proper.
Its abandonment through delusion I is
described as of the quality of darkness.
When a man abandons action, merely as being
troublesome, through fear of bodily affliction, he
does not obtain the fruit of abandonment by making
(such) passionate abandonment.
When prescribed action is performed, O Arguna!
abandoning attachment and fruit also, merely
because it ought to be performed, that is deemed (to be)
a good abandonment.
He who is possessed of abandonment, being full
of goodness, and talented, and having his doubts
destroyed, is not averse from unpleasant actions, is not
attached to pleasant (ones).
Since no embodied (being) can abandon actions
without exception, he is said to be possessed of
abandonment, who abandons the fruit of action.
The threefold fruit of action, agreeable,
disagreeable, and mixed, accrues after death to those
who
are not possessed of abandonment, but never to
renouncers.
Learn from me, O you of mighty arms! these five
causes of the completion of all actions, declared
in the Sankhya system.
The substratum, the agent likewise, the various
sorts of organs, and the various and distinct
movements, and with these the deities, too, as the fifth.
Whatever action, just or otherwise, a man
performs with his body, speech, and mind, these five are
its causes.
That being so, the undiscerning man, who being
of an unrefined understanding, sees the agent in
the immaculate self, sees not (rightly).
He who has no feeling of egoism, and whose
mind is not tainted, even though he kills (all) these
people, kills not, is not fettered (by the action).
Knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knower
threefold is the prompting to action. The
instrument, the action, the agent, thus in brief is action
threefold.
Knowledge and action and agent are declared in
the enumeration of qualities (to be) of three
classes only, according to the difference of qualities.
Hear about these also as they really are.
Know that knowledge to be good, by which (a
man) sees one entity, inexhaustible, and not
different in all things (apparently) different (from one
another).
Know that knowledge to be passionate, which is
(based) on distinctions (between different
entities), which sees in all things various entities of
different kinds.
And that is described as dark, which clings to one
created (thing) only as everything, which is
devoid of reason, devoid of real principle, and
insignificant.
That action is called good, which is prescribed,
which is devoid of attachment, which is not done
from (motives of) affection or aversion, (and which is
done) by one not wishing for the fruit.
That is described as passionate, which
(occasions) much trouble, is performed by one who
wishes
for objects of desire, or one who is full of egotism.
The action is called dark, which is commenced
through delusion, without regard to consequences,
loss, injury, or strength.
That agent is called good, who has cast off
attachment, who is free from egotistic talk, who is
possessed of courage and energy, and unaffected by
success or ill-success.
That agent is called passionate, who is full of
affections, who wishes for the fruit of actions, who is
covetous, cruel, and impure, and feels joy and sorrow.
That agent is called dark, who is without
application, void of discernment, headstrong, crafty,
malicious, lazy, melancholy, and slow.
Now hear, O Dhanangaya! the threefold division
of intelligence and courage, according to
qualities, which I am about to declare exhaustively and
distinctly.
That intelligence, O son of Pritha! is good which
understands action and inaction, what ought to
be done and what ought not to be done, danger and the
absence of danger, emancipation and bondage.
That intelligence, O son of Pritha! is passionate,
by which one imperfectly understands piety and
impiety, what ought to be done and also what ought not to
be done.
That intelligence, O son of Pritha! is dark, which
shrouded by darkness, understands impiety (to
be) piety, and all things incorrectly.
That courage, O son of Pritha! is good courage,
which is unswerving, and by which one controls
the operations of the mind, breath, and senses, through
abstraction.
But, O Arguna! that courage is passionate, by
which one adheres to piety, lust, and wealth, and
through attachment wishes, O son of Pritha! for the fruit.
That courage is dark, O son of Pritha! by which an
undiscerning man does not give up sleep, fear,
sorrow, despondency, and folly.
Now, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! hear
from me about the three sorts of happiness.
That happiness is called good, in which one is
pleased after repetition (of enjoyment), and reaches
the close of all misery, which is like poison first and
comparable to nectar in the long run, and which is
produced from a clear knowledge of the self.
That happiness is called passionate, which (flows)
from contact between the senses and their
objects, and which is at first comparable to nectar and in
the long run like poison.
That happiness is described as dark, which arises
from sleep, laziness, heedlessness, which
deludes the self, both at first and in its consequences.
There is no entity either on earth or in heaven
among the gods, which is free from these three
qualities born of nature.
The duties of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and
Vaisyas, and of Sudras, too, O terror of your foes! are
distinguished according to the qualities born of nature.
Tranquillity, restraint of the senses, penance,
purity, forgiveness, straightforwardness, also
knowledge, experience, and belief (in a future world), this
is the natural duty of Brahmanas.
Valour, glory, courage, dexterity, not slinking away
from battle, gifts, exercise of lordly power,
this is the natural duty of Kshatriyas.
Agriculture, tending cattle, trade, (this) is the
natural duty of Vaisyas. And the natural duty of
Sudras, too, consists in service.
(Every) man intent on his own respective duties
obtains perfection. Listen, now, how one intent
on one's own duty obtains perfection.
Worshipping, by (the performance of) his own
duty, him from whom all things proceed, and by
whom all this is permeated, a man obtains perfection.
One's duty, though defective, is better than
another's duty well performed.
Performing the duty prescribed by nature, one
does not incur sin. O son of Kunti! one should not
abandon a natural duty though tainted with evil; for all
actions are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke.
One who is self-restrained, whose understanding
is unattached everywhere, from whom affections
have departed, obtains the supreme perfection of
freedom from action by renunciation.
Learn from me, only in brief, O son of Kunti! how
one who has obtained perfection attains the
Brahman, which is the highest culmination of knowledge.
A man possessed of a pure understanding,
controlling his self by courage, discarding sound and
other objects of sense, casting off affection and aversion;
who frequents clean places, who eats little, whose
speech, body, and mind are restrained, who is
always intent on meditation and mental abstraction, and
has recourse to unconcern,
who abandoning egoism, stubbornness,
arrogance, desire, anger, and (all) belongings, has no
(thought that this or that is) mine, and who is tranquil,
becomes fit for assimilation with the Brahman.
Thus reaching the Brahman, and with a tranquil
self, he grieves not, wishes not; but being alike to
all beings, obtains the highest devotion to me.
By (that) devotion he truly understands who I am
and how great. And then understanding me
truly, he forthwith enters into my (essence).
Even performing all actions, always depending on
me, he, through my favour, obtains the
imperishable and eternal seat.
Dedicating in thought all actions to me, be
constantly given up to me, (placing) your thoughts on
me, through recourse to mental abstraction.
(Placing) your thoughts on me, you will cross over
all difficulties by my favour. But if you will not
listen through egotism, you will be ruined.
If entertaining egotism, you think that you may not
fight, vain, indeed, is that resolution of yours.
Nature will constrain you. That, O son of Kunti!
which through delusion you do not wish to do,
you will do involuntarily, tied down by your own duty,
flowing from your nature.
The lord, O Arguna! is seated in the region of the
heart of all beings, turning round all beings (as
though) mounted on a machine, by his delusion.
With him, O descendant of Bharata! seek shelter
in every way; by his favour you will obtain the
highest tranquillity, the eternal seat.
Thus have I declared to you the knowledge more
mysterious than any mystery. Ponder over it
thoroughly, and then act as you like.
Once more, listen to my excellent words most
mysterious of all. Strongly I like you, therefore I
will declare what ts for your welfare.
On me (place) your mind, become my devotee,
sacrifice to me, reverence me, and you will
certainly come to me. I declare to you truly, you are dear
to me.
Forsaking all duties, come to me as (your) sole
refuge. I will release you from all sins. Be not
grieved.
This you should never declare to one who
performs no penance, who is not a devotee, nor to one
who does not wait on (some preceptor), nor yet to one
who calumniates me.
He who, with the highest devotion to me, will
proclaim this supreme mystery among my devotees,
will come to me, freed from (all) doubts.
No one amongst men is superior to him in doing
what is dear to me. And there will never be
another on earth dearer to me than he.
And he who will study this holy dialogue of ours,
will, such is my opinion, have offered to me the
sacrifice of knowledge.
And the man, also, who with faith and without
carping will listen (to this), will be freed (from
sin), and attain to the holy regions of those who perform
pious acts.
Have you listened to this, O son of Pritha! with a
mind (fixed) on (this) one point only? Has your
delusion (caused) by ignorance been destroyed, O
Dhanangaya?
Arguna said:
Destroyed is my delusion; by your favour, O
undegraded one! I (now) recollect myself I stand freed
from doubts. I will do your bidding.
Sangaya said:
Thus did I hear this dialogue between Vasudeva
and the high-minded son of Pritha, (a dialogue)
wonderful and causing the hair to stand on end.
By the favour of Vyasa, I heard this highest
mystery, (this) devotion, from Krishna himself, the
lord of the possessors of mystic power, who proclaimed it
in person.
O king! remembering and (again) remembering
this wonderful and holy dialogue of Kesava and
Arguna, I rejoice over and over again.
And remembering and (again) remembering that
excessively wonderful form of Hari also, great is
my amazement, O king! and I rejoice over and over
again.
Wherever (is) Krishna, the lord of the possessors
of mystic power, wherever (is) the (great) archer,
the son of Pritha, there in my opinion (are) fortune,
victory, prosperity, and eternal justice.
Upanishads,
translated by F. Max Muller
Khandogya-Upanishad
First Prapathaka

Let a man meditate on the syllable Om, called the
udgitha; for the udgitha (a portion of the Samaveda) is sung, beginning with Om.
The full account, however, of Om is this:
The essence of all beings is the earth, the essence
of the earth is water, the essence of water the
plants, the essence of plants man, the essence of man
speech, the essence of speech the Rig-veda, the
essence of the Rig-veda the Sama-veda, the essence of
the Sama-veda the udgitha (which is Om).
That udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the
highest, deserving the highest place, the eighth.
What then is the Rik? What is the Saman? What
is the udgitha? This is the question.
The Rik indeed is speech, Saman is breath, the
udgitha is the syllable Om. Now speech and
breath, or Rik and Saman, form one couple.
And that couple is joined together in the syllable
Om. When two people come together, they fulfil
each other's desire.
Thus he who knowing this, meditates on the
syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes indeed a fulfiller
of desires.
That syllable is a syllable of permission, for
whenever we permit anything, we say Om, yes. Now
permission is gratification. He who knowing this
meditates on the syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes
indeed a gratifier of desires.
By that syllable does the threefold knowledge (the
sacrifice, more particularly the Soma-sacrifice,
as founded on the three Vedas) proceed. When the
Adhvaryu priest gives an order, he says Om. When
the Hotri priest recites, he says Om. When the Udgatri
priest sings, he says Om, all for the glory of
that syllable. The threefold knowledge (the sacrifice)
proceeds by the greatness of that syllable (the vital
breaths), and by its essence (the oblations).
Now therefore it would seem to follow, that both
he who knows this (the true meaning of the
syllable Om), and he who does not, perform the same
sacrifice. But this is not so, for knowledge and
ignorance are different. The sacrifice which a man
performs with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishad is
more powerful. This is the full account of the syllable Om.

When the Devas and Asuras struggled together,
both of the race of Pragapati, the Devas took the
udgitha (Om), thinking they would vanquish the Asuras
with it.
They meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the breath
(scent) in the nose, but the Asuras pierced it (the
breath) with evil. Therefore we smell by the breath in the
nose both what is good-smelling and what is
bad-smelling. For the breath was pierced by evil.
Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as
speech, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. Therefore
we speak both truth and falsehood. For speech is
pierced by evil.
Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
eye, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. Therefore
we see both what is sightly and unsightly. For the eye is
pierced by evil.
Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
ear, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. Therefore
we hear both what should be heard and what should not
be heard. For the ear is pierced by evil.
Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
mind, but the Asuras pierced it with evil.
Therefore we conceive both what should be conceived
and what should not be conceived. For the mind is
pierced by evil.
Then comes this breath (of life) in the mouth. They
meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that breath.
When the Asuras came to it, they were scattered, as (a
ball of earth) would be scattered when hitting a
solid stone.
Thus, as a ball of earth is scattered when hitting
on a solid stone, will he be scattered who wishes
evil to one who knows this, or who persecutes him; for he
is a solid stone.
By it (the breath in the mouth) he distinguishes
neither what is good nor what is bad-smelling, for
that breath is free from evil. What we eat and drink with it
supports the other vital breaths (i.e. the
senses, such as smell, &c.) When at the time of death he
does not find that breath (in the mouth, through
which he eats and drinks lives), then he departs. He
opens the mouth at the time of death (as if wishing to
eat).
Angiras meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that
breath, and people hold it to be Angiras, i.e. the
essence of the members (anganam rasah);
Therefore Brihaspati meditated on udgitha (Om)
as that breath, and people hold it to be
Brihaspati, for speech is brihati, and he (that breath) is
the lord (pati) of speech;
Therefore Ayasya meditated on the udgitha (Om)
as that breath, and people hold it to be Ayasya,
because it comes (ayati) from the mouth (asya);
Therefore Vaka Dalbhya knew it. He was the
Udgatri (singer) of the Naimishiya-sacrificers, and
by singing he obtained for them their wishes.
He who knows this, and meditates on the syllable
Om (the imperishable udgitha) as the breath of
life in the mouth, he obtains all wishes by singing. So
much for the udgitha (Om) as meditated on with
reference to the body.

Now follows the meditation on the udgitha with
reference to the gods. Let a man meditate on the
udgitha (Om) as he who sends warmth (the sun in the
sky). When the sun rises it sings as Udgatri for the
sake of all creatures. When it rises it destroys the fear of
darkness. He who knows this, is able to destroy
the fear of darkness (ignorance).
This (the breath in the mouth) and that (the sun)
are the same. This is hot and that is hot. This
they call svara (sound), and that they call pratyasvara
(reflected sound). Therefore let a man meditate on
the udgitha (Om) as this and that (as breath and as sun).
Then let a man meditate on the udgitha (Om) as
vyana indeed. If we breathe up, that is prana, the
up-breathing. If we breathe down, that is apana, the
down-breathing. The combination of prana and
apana is vyana, back-breathing or holding in of the
breath. This vyana is speech. Therefore when we
utter speech, we neither breathe up nor down.
Speech is Rik, and therefore when a man utters a
Rik verse he neither breathes up nor down.
Rik is Saman, and therefore when a man utters a
Saman verse he neither breathes up nor down.
Saman is udgitha, and therefore when a man sings (the
udgitha, Om) he neither breathes up nor down.
And other works also which require strength, such
as the production of fire by rubbing, running a
race, stringing a strong bow, are performed without
breathing up or down. Therefore let a man meditate
on the udgitha (Om) as vyana.
Let a man meditate on the syllables of the udgitha,
i.e. of the word udgitha. Ut is breath (prana),
for by means of breath a man rises (uttishthati). Gi is
speech, for speeches are called girah. Tha is food,
for by means of food all subsists (sthita).
Ut is heaven, gi the sky, tha the earth. Ut is the
sun, gi the air, tha the fire. Ut is the Sama-veda, gi
the Yagur-veda, tha the Rig-veda.
Speech yields the milk, which is the milk of speech itself,
to him who thus knowing meditates on those
syllables of the name of udgitha, he becomes rich in food
and able to eat food.
Next follows the fulfilment of prayers. Let a man
thus meditate on the Upasaranas, i.e. the objects
which have to be approached by meditation: Let him (the
Udgatri) quickly reflect on the Saman with
which he is going to praise;
Let him quickly reflect on the Rik in which that
Saman occurs; on the Rishi (poet) by whom it was
seen or composed; on the Devata (object) which he is
going to praise;
On the metre in which he is going to praise; on
the tune with which he is going to sing for
himself;
On the quarter of the world which he is going to
praise. Lastly, having approached himself (his
name, family, &c.) by meditation, let him sing the hymn of
praise, reflecting on his desire, and avoiding
all mistakes in pronunciation, &c. Quickly will the desire
be then fulfilled to him, for the sake of which he
may have offered his hymn of praise, yea, for which he
may have offered his hymn of praise.

Let a man meditate on the syllable Om, for the
udgitha is sung beginning with Om. And this is
the full account of the syllable Om:
The Devas, being afraid of death, entered upon
(the performance of the sacrifice prescribed in) the
threefold knowledge (the three Vedas). They covered
themselves with the metrical hymns. Because they
covered (khad) themselves with the hymns, therefore the
hymns are called khandas.
Then, as a fisherman might observe a fish in the
water, Death observed the Devas in the Rik,
