The hotar, lavishest of wealth. 
Worthy is Agni to be praised by living as by ancient seers. 
He shall bring, hitherward the Gods. 
Through Agni man obtaineth wealth, yea, plenty waxing day by day, 
Most rich in heroes, glorious. 
Agni, the perfect sacrifice which thou encompassest about 
May Agni, sapient-minded Priest, truthful, most gloriously great, 
The God, come hither with the Gods. 
Whatever blessing, Agni, thou wilt grant unto thy worshipper, 
That, Angiras, is indeed thy truth. 
To thee, dispeller of the night, O Agni, day by day with prayer 
Bringing thee reverence, we come 
Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One, 
Increasing in thine own abode. 
Be to us easy of approach, even as a father to his son: 
Agni, be with us for our weal. 
BEAUTIFUL Vayu, come, for thee these Soma drops have been prepared: 
Drink of them, hearken to our call. 
Knowing the days, with Soma juice poured forth, the singers glorify 
Thee, Vayu, with their hymns of praise. 
Far-spreading for the Soma draught. 
These, Indra-Vayu, have been shed; come for our offered dainties' sake: 
The drops are yearning for you both. 
Well do ye mark libations, ye Vayu and Indra, rich in spoil 
So come ye swiftly hitherward. 
Soon, Heroes, thus I make my prayer. 
Mitra, of holy strength, I call, and foe-destroying Varuna, 
Who make the oil-fed rite complete. 
Mitra and Varuna, through Law, lovers and cherishers of Law, 
Have ye obtained your might power 
Our Sages, Mitra-Varuna, wide dominion, strong by birth. 
YE Asvins, rich in treasure, Lords of splendour, having nimble hands, 
Accept the sacrificial food. 
Ye Asvins, rich in wondrous deeds, ye heroes worthy of our praise, 
Accept our songs with mighty thought. 
Nisatyas, wonder-workers, yours arc these libations with dipt grass: 
Come ye whose paths are red with flame. 
O Indra marvellously bright, come, these libations long for thee, 
Thus by fine fingers purified. 
Urged by the holy singer, sped by song, come, Indra, to the prayers, 
Of the libation-pouring priest. 
Approach, O Indra, hasting thee, Lord of Bay Horses, to the prayers. 
In our libation take delight. 
Ye Visvedevas, who protect, reward, and cherish men, approach 
Your worshipper's drink-offering. 
Ye Visvedevas, swift at work, come hither quickly to the draught. 
As milch-kine hasten to their stalls. 
The Visvedevas, changing shape like serpents, fearless, void of guile, 
Bearers, accept the sacred draught 
Wealthy in spoil, enriched with hymns, may bright Sarsavad desire, 
With eager love, our sacrifice. 
Inciter of all pleasant songs, inspirer o all gracious thought, 
Sarasvati accept our rite 
Sarasvati, the mighty flood,- she with be light illuminates, She brightens every pi 
ous thought. 
As a good cow to him who milks, we call the doer of fair deeds, 
To our assistance day by day. 
Come thou to our libations, drink of Soma; Soma-drinker thou! 
The rich One's rapture giveth kine. 
So may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence: 
Neglect us not, come hitherward. 
Go to the wise unconquered One, ask thou of Indra, skilled in song. 
Him who is better than thy friends. 
Whether the men who mock us say, Depart unto another place, 
Ye who serve Indra and none else; 
Or whether, God of wondrous deeds, all our true people call us blest. 
Still may we dwell in Indra's care. 
Unto the swift One bring the swift, man-cheering, grace of sacrifice, 
That to the Friend gives wings and joy. 
Thou, Satakratu, drankest this and wast the Vrtras' slayer; thou 
Helpest the warrior in the fray. 
We strengthen, Satakratu, thee, yea, thee the powerful in fight. 
That, Indra, we may win us wealth. 
To him the mighty stream of wealth, prompt friend ot'him who pours the juice, 
yea, to this Indra sing your song. 
O COME ye hither, sit ye down: to Indra sing ye forth, your song, 
companions, bringing hymns of praise. 
To him the richest of the rich, the Lord of treasures excellent, 
Indra, wi th Soma juice outpoured. 
May he stand by us in our need and in abundance for our wealth: 
May he come nigh us with his strength. 
Whose pair of tawny horses yoked in battles foemen challenge not: 
To him, to Indra sing your song. 
Nigh to the Soma-drinker come, for his enjoyment, these pure drops, 
The Somas mingled with the curd. 
Thou, grown at once to perfect strength, wast born to drink the Soma juice, 
Strong Indra, for preeminence. 
O Indra, lover of the song, may these quick Somas enter thee: 
May they bring bliss to thee the Sage. 
Our chants of praise have strengthened thee, O Satakratu, and our lauds 
So strengthen thee the songs we sing. 
Indra, whose succour never fails, accept these viands thousandfold, 
Wherein all manly powers abide. 
O Indra, thou who lovest song, let no man hurt our bodies, keep 
Slaughter far from us, for thou canst. 
They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the ruddy Steed 
The lights are shining in the sky. 
On both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him. 
Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief. 
Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men: where form was not, 
Wast born together with the Dawns. 
Thereafter they, as is their wont, threw off the state of babes unborn. 
Assuming sacrificial names. 
Thou, Indra, with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of what is firm ' 
Foundest the kine even in the cave. 
Worshipping even as they list, singers laud him who findeth wealth, 
The far-renowned, the mighty One. 
Mayest thou verily be seen coming by fearless Indra's side: 
Both joyous, equal in your sheen. 
With Indra's well beloved hosts, the blameless, hastening to heaven, 
The sacrificer cries aloud. 
Come from this place, O Wanderer, or downward from the light of heaven: 
Our songs of praise all yearn for this. 
Indra we seek to give us help, from here, from heaven above the earth. 
Or from the spacious firmament. 
INDRA the singers with high praise, Indra reciters with their lauds, 
Indra the choirs have glorified. 
Indra hath ever close to him his two bay steeds and word-yoked car, 
Indra the golden, thunder-armed. 
Indra hath raised the Sun on high in heaven, that he may see afar: 
He burst the mountain for the kine. 
Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained, 
With awful aids, O awful One. 
In mighty battle we invoke Indra, Indra in lesser fight. 
The Friend who bends his bolt at fiends. 
Unclose, our manly Hero, thou for ever bounteous, yonder cloud, 
For us, thou irresistible. 
Still higher, at each strain of mine, thunder-armed Indra's praises rise: 
Even as the bull drives on the herds, he drives the people with his might. 
The Ruler irresistible: 
Indra who rules with single sway men, riches, and the fivefold race 
Of those who dwell upon the earth. 
For your sake from each side we call Indra away from other men: 
Ours, and none others', may he be. 
INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering wealth. Most excellent, to be ou 
r aid; 
By means of which we may repel our foes in battle hand to hand, 
By thee assisted with the car. 
Aided by thee, the thunder-armed, Indra, may we lift up the bolt. 
And conquer all our foes in fight. 
With thee, O India, for ally with missile-darting heroes, may 
We conquer our embattled foes. 
Mighty is Indra, yea supreme; greatness be his, the Thunderer: 
Wide as the heaven extends his power 
Which aideth those to win them sons, who come as heroes to the fight. 
Or singers loving holy thoughts. 
His belly, drinking deepest draughts of Soma, like an ocean swells, 
Like wide streams from the cope of heaven. 
So also is his excellence, great, vigorous, rich in cattle, like 
A ripe branch to the worshipper. 
For verily thy mighty powers, Indra, are saving helps at once 
Unto a worshipper like me. 
So are his lovely gifts; let lauds and praises be to Indra sung. 
That he may drink the Soma juice. 
COME, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all the Soma feasts, 
Protector, mighty in thy strength. 
To Indra pour ye forth thejuice, the active gladdening juice to him 
He gladdening, oinnific God. 
O Lord of all men, fair of cheek, rejoice thee in the gladdening lauds, 
Present at these drink-offerings. 
Songs have outpoured themselves to thee, Indra, the strong, the guardian Lord, 
And raised themselves unsatisfied. 
Send to us bounty manifold, O Indra, worthy of our wish. 
Lor power supreme is only thine. 
O Indra, stimulate thereto us emulously fain for wealth. 
And glorious, O most splendid One. 
Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame, wealthy in cattle and in strength. 
Lasting our life-time, failing not. 
Grant us high fame, O Indra, grant riches bestowing thousands, those 
Pair fruits of earth borne home in wains. 
Praising with songs the praise-worthy who cometh to our aid, we call 
Indra, the Treasure-Lord of wealth. 
To lofty Indra, dweller by each libation, the pious man 
Sings forth aloud a strengthening hymn. 
THE chanters hymn thee, they who say the word of praise magnify thee. 
The priests have raised thee up on high, O Satakratu, like a pole. 
As up he clomb from ridge to ridge and looked upon the toilsome task, 
Indra observes this wish of his, and the Rain hastens with his troop. 
Harness thy pair of strong bay steeds, long-maned, whose bodies fill the girths, 
And, Indra, Soma-drinker, come to listen to our songs of praise. 
Come hither, answer thou the song, sing in approval, cry aloud. 
Good Indra, make our prayer succeed, and prosper this our sacrifice. 
To Indra must a laud be said, to strengthen him who freely gives, 
That Sakra may take pleasure in our friendship and drink-offerings. 
Him, him we seek for friendship, him for riches and heroic might. 
Lor Indra, he is Sakra, he shall aid us while he gives us wealth. 
Easy to turn and drive away, Indra, is spoil bestowed by thee. 
Unclose the stable of the kine, and give us wealth O Thunder-armed 
The heaven and earth contain thee not, together, in thy wrathful mood. 
Win us the waters of the sky, and send us kine abundantly. 
Hear, thou whose ear is quick, my call; take to thee readily my songs 
O Indra, let this laud of mine come nearer even than thy friend. 
We know thee mightiest of all, in battles hearer of our cry. 
Of thee most mighty we invoke the aid that giveth thousandfold. 
Indra, Son of Kusika, drink our libation with delight. 
Prolong our life anew, and cause the seer to win a thousand gifts. 
Lover of song, may these our songs on every side encompass thee: 
Strengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear delights to thee. 
ALL sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea, 
The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord of strength. 
Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no fear. 
We glorify with praises thee, the never-conquered conqueror. 
The gifts of Indra from of old, his saving succours, never fail, 
When to the praise-singers he gives the boon of substance rich in kine. 
Crusher of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he born 
Sustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled. 
Lord of the thunder, thou didst burst the cave of Vala rich in cows. 
The Gods came pressing to thy side, and free from terror aided thee, 
I, Hero, through thy bounties am come to the flood addressing thee. 
Song-lover, here the singers stand and testify to thee thereof. 
The wily Susna, Indra! thou o'er-threwest with thy wondrous powers. 
The wise beheld this deed of thine: now go beyond their eulogies. 
Our songs of praise have glorified Indra who ruleth by his might, 
Whose precious gifts in thousands come, yea, even more abundantly. 
WE choose Agni the messenger, the herald, master of all wealth. 
Well skilled in this our sacrifice. 
With callings ever they invoke Agni, Agni, Lord of the House, 
Oblation-bearer, much beloved. 
Bring the Gods hither, Agni, born for him who strews the sacred grass: 
Thou art our herald, meet for praise. 
Wake up the willing Gods, since thou, Agni, performest embassage: 
Sit on the sacred grass with Gods. 
O Agni, radiant One, to whom the holy oil is poured, bum up 
Our enemies whom fiends protect. 
By Agni Agni is inflamed, Lord of the House, wise, young, who bears 
The gift: the ladle is his mouth. 
Praise Agni in the sacrifice, the Sage whose ways are ever true, 
The God who driveth grief away. 
God, Agni, be his strong defence who lord of sacrificial gifts, 
Worshippeth thee the messenger. 
Whoso with sacred gift would fain call Agni to the feast of Gods, 
O Purifier, favour him. 
Such, Agni, Purifier, bright, bring hither to our sacrifice, 
To our oblation bring the Gods. 
So lauded by our newest song of praise bring opulence to us, 
And food, with heroes for our sons. 
O Agni, by effulgent flame, by all invokings of the Gods, 
Show pleasure in this laud of ours. 
AGNI, well-kindled, bring the Gods for him who offers holy gifts. 
Worship them. Purifier, Priest. 
Son of Thyself, present, O Sage, our sacrifice to the Gods today. 
Sweet to the taste, that they may feast. 
Dear Narasamsa, sweet of tongue, the giver of oblations, 1 
Invoke to this our sacrifice. 
Agni, on thy most easy car, glorified, hither bring the Gods: 
Manu appointed thee as Priest. 
Strew, O ye wise, the sacred grass that drips with oil, in order due, 
Where the Immortal is beheld. 
Thrown open be the Doors Divine, unfailing, that assist the rite, 
For sacrifice this day and now. 
At this our solemn sacrifice. 
The two Invokers I invite, the wise, divine and sweet of tongue, 
To celebrate this our sacrifice. 
Ila, Sarasvati, Mahi, three Goddesses who bring delight. 
Be seated, peaceful, on the grass. 
Tvastar I call, the earliest born, the wearer of all forms at will: 
May he be ours and curs alone. 
God, Sovran of the Wood, present this our oblation to the Gods, 
And let the giver be renowned. 
With Svaha. pay the sacrifice to Indra in the offerer's house: 
Thither I call the Deities. 
To drink the Soma, Agni, come, to our service and our songs. 
With ah these Gods; and worship them. 
The Kanvas have invoked thee; they, O Singer, sing thee songs of praise 
Agni, come hither with the Gods; 
Indra, Vayu, Brhaspati, Mitra, Agni, Pusan, Bhaga, 
Adityas, and the Marut host. 
For you these juices are poured forth that gladden and exhilarate, 
The meath-drops resting in the cup. 
The sons of Kanva fain for help adore thee, having strewn the grass, 
With offerings and ah things prepared. 
Let the swift steeds who carry thee, thought-yoked and dropping holy oil, 
Bring the Gods to the Soma draught. 
Adored, the strengtheners of Law, unite them, Agni, with their Dames: 
Make them drink meath, O bright of tongue. 
Let them, O Agni, who deserve worship and praise drink with thy tongue 
Tie meath in solemn sacrifice. 
Away, from the Sun's realm of light, the wise invoking Priest shall bring 
All Gods awaking with the dawn. 
With all the Gods, with Indra, with Vayu, and Mitra's splendours, drink, 
Agni, the pleasant Soma juice. 
Ordained by Manu as our Priest, thou sittest, Agni, at each rite: 
Hallow thou this our sacrifice. 
Harness the Red Mares to thy car, the Bays, O God, the flaming ones: 
With those bring hitherward the Gods. 
O INDRA drink the Soma juice with Rtu; let the cheering drops 
Sink deep within, which settle there. 
Drink from the Purifier's cup, Maruts, with Rtu; sanctify 
The rite, for ye give precious gifts. 
O Nestar, with thy Dame accept our sacrifice; with Rtu drink, 
For thou art he who giveth wealth. 
Bring the Gods, Agni; in the three appointed places set them down: 
Surround them, and with Rtu drink. 
Drink Soma after the Rtus, from the Brahmana's bounty: undissolved, 
O Indra, is thy friendship's bond. 
Mitra, Varuna, ye whose ways are firm - a Power that none deceives-, 
With Rtu ye have reached the rite. 
The Soma-pressers, fain for wealth, praise the Wealth-giver in the rite, 
In sacrifices praise the God. 
May the Wealth-giver grant to us riches that shall be far renowned. 
These things we gain, among the Gods. 
He with the Rtu fain would drink, Wealth-giver, from the Nestar's bowl. 
Haste, give your offering, and depart. 
As we this fourth time. Wealth-giver, honour thee with the Rtus, be 
A Giver bountiful to us. 
Drink ye the meath, O Asvins bright with flames, whose acts are pure, who with 
Rtus accept the sacrifice. 
With Rtu, through the house-fire, thou, kind Giver, guidest sacrifice: 
Worship the Gods for the pious man. 
LET thy Bay Steeds bring thee, the Strong, hither to drink the Soma draught- Those, Indra, who are 
bright as suns. 
Here are the grains bedewed with oil: hither let the Bay Coursers bring 
Indra upon his easiest car. 
Indra at early morn we call, Indra in course of sacrifice, 
Indra to drink the Soma juice. 
Come hither, with thy long-maned Steeds, O Indra, to- the draught we pour 
We call thee wher, the juice is shed. 
Come thou to this our song of praise, to the libation poured for thee 
Drink of it like a stag athirst. 
Here are the drops of Soma juice expressed on sacred grass: thereof 
Drink, Indra, to increase thy might. 
Welcome to thee be this our hymn, reaching thy heart, most excellent: 
Then drink the Soma juice expressed. 
To every draught of pressed-out juice Indra, the Vrtra-slayer, comes, 
To drink the Soma for delight. 
Fulfil, O Satakratu, all our wish with horses and with kine: 
With holy thoughts we sing thy praise. 
Both favour one of us like me. 
Guardians of men, ye ever come with ready succour at the call 
Of every singer such as I. 
Sate you, according to your wish, O Indra-Varuna, with wealth: 
Fain would we have you nearest us. 
May we be sharers of the powers, sharers of the benevolence 
Of you who give strength bounteously. 
Indra and Varuna, among givers of thousands, meet for praise, 
Are Powers who merit highest laud. 
Through their protection may we gain great store of wealth, and heap it up 
Enough and still to spare, be ours. 
O Indra-Varuna, on you for wealth in many a form I call: 
Still keep ye us victorious. 
O Indra-Varuna, - through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves, 
Give us at once your sheltering help. 
O Indra-Varuna, to you may fair praise which I offer come, 
joint eulogy which ye dignify. 
O BRAHMANAPSATI, make him who presses Soma glorious, 
Even Kaksivan Ausija. 
The rich, the healer of disease, who giveth wealth, increaseth store, 
The prompt, -may he be with us still. 
Let not the foeman's curse, let not a mortal's onslaught fall on us 
Preserve us, Brahmanaspati. 
Ne'er is the mortal hero harmed whom Indra, Brahmanaspati, 
And Soma graciously inspire. 
Do, thou, O Brahmanaspati, and Indra, Soma, Daksina, 
Preserve that mortal from distress. 
To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend who gives 
Wisdom, have I drawn near in prayer. 
He without whom no sacrifice, e'en of the wise man, prospers; he 
Stirs up the series of thoughts. 
He makes the oblation prosper, he promotes the course of sacrifice: 
Our voice of praise goes to the Gods. 
As 'twere the Household Priest of heaven. 
To this fair sacrifice to drink the milky draught thou art invoked: 
O Agni, with the Maruts come. 
No mortal man, no God exceeds thy mental power, O Mighty one - 
O Agni, with the Maruts come 
All Gods devoid of guile, who know the mighty region of mid-air: 
O Agni, with those Maruts come. 
The terrible, who sing their song, not to be overcome by might: 
O Agni, with those Maruts come. 
Brilliant, and awful in their form, mighty, devourers of their foes': 
O Agni, with those Maruts come. 
Who sit as Deities in heaven, above the sky-vault's luminous sphere: 
O Agni, with those Maruts come. 
Who scatter clouds about the sky, away over the billowy sea: 
O Agni, with those Maruts come. 
Who with their bright beams spread them forth over the ocean in their might 
O Agni, with those Maruts come. 
For thee, to be thine early draught, I pour the Soma-mingled meath: 
O Agni, with the Maruts come. 
FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishly 
Was made by singers with their lips. 
They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a word, 
Attained by works to sacrifice. 
They for the two Nasatyas wrought a light car moving every way: 
They formed a nectar-yielding cow. 
The Rbhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, made 
Their Sire and Mother young again. 
Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Maruts girt. 
With the Adityas, with the Kings. 
The sacrificial ladle, wrought newly by the God Tvastar's hand- 
Four ladles have ye made thereof. 
Give wealth, pleased with our eulogies. 
As ministering Priests they held, by pious acts they won themselves, 
A share in sacrifice with Gods. 
INDRA and Agni I invoke fain are we for their song of praise 
Chief Soma-drinkers are they both. 
Praise ye, O men, and glorify Indra-Agni in the holy rites: 
Sing praise to them in sacred songs. 
Indra and Agni we invite, the Soma-drinkers, for the fame 
Of Mitra, to the Soma-draught. 
Strong Gods, we bid them come to this libation that stands ready here: 
Indra and Agni, come to us. 
Indra and Agni, mighty Lords of our assembly, crush the fiends: 
Childless be the devouring ones. 
Watch ye, through this your truthfulness, there in the place of spacious view 
Indra and Agni, send us bliss. 
WAKEN the Asvin Pair who yoke their car at early morn: may they 
Approach to drink this Soma juice. 
We call the Asvins Twain, the Gods borne in a noble car, the best 
Of charioteers, who reach the heavens. 
Dropping with honey is your whip, Asvins, and full of pleasantness 
Sprinkle therewith the sacrifice. 
As ye go thither in your car, not far, O Asvins, is the home 
Of him who offers Soma juice. 
For my protection I invoke the golden-handed Savitar. 
He knoweth, as a God, the place. 
That he may send us succour, praise the Waters' Offspring Savitar: 
Fain are we for his holy ways. 
We call on him, distributer of wondrous bounty and of wealth. 
On Savitar who looks on men. 
Come hither, friends, and seat yourselves Savitar, to be praised by us, 
Giving good gifts, is beautiful. 
O Agni, hither bring to us the willing Spouses of the Gods, 
And Tvastar, to the Soma draught. 
Most youthful Agni, hither bring their Spouses, Hotra, Bharati, 
Spouses of Heroes, Goddesses, with whole wings may they come to us 
With great protection and with aid. 
Indrani, Varunani, and Agnayi hither I invite, 
For weal, to drink the Soma juice. 
May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, bedew for us our sacrifice, 
And feed us full with nourishments. 
Their water rich with fatness, there in the Gandharva's steadfast place, 
The singers taste through sacred songs. 
Thornless be thou, O Earth, spread wide before us for a dwelling-place: 
The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Visnu strode 
Through the seven regions of the earth! 
Through all this world strode Visnu; thrice his foot he planted, and the whole 
Was gathered in his footstep's dust. 
Establishing his high decrees. 
Look ye on Visnu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra, close-allied. 
Hath let his holy ways be seen. 
The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Visnu is, 
Laid as it were an eye in heaven. 
This, Vishnu's station most sublime, the singers, ever vigilant, 
Lovers of holy song, light up. 
STRONG are the Somas; come thou nigh; these juices have been mixt with milk: 
Drink, Vayu, the presented draughts. 
Both Deities who touch the heaven, Indra and Vayu we invoke 
To drink of this our soma juice. 
The singers' for their aid, invoke Indra and Vayu, swift as mind, 
The thousand-eyed, the Lords of thought. 
Mitra and Varupa, renowned as Gods of consecrated might. 
We call to drink the Soma juice. 
Those who by Law uphold the Law, Lords of the shining light of Law, 
Mitra I call, and Varuna. 
Let Varuna be our chief defence, let Mitra guard us with all aids 
Both make us rich exceedingly. 
Indra, by Maruts girt, we call to drink the Soma juice: may he 
Sate him in union with his troop. 
Gods, Marut hosts whom Indra leads, distributers of Pusan's gifts, 
Hearken ye all unto my cry. 
With conquering Indra for ally, strike Vrtra down, ye bounteous Gods 
Let not the wicked master us. 
We call the Universal Gods, and Maruts to the Soma draught, 
For passing strong are Prsni's Sons. 
Fierce comes the Maruts' thundering voice, like that of conquerors, when ye go 
Forward to victory, O Men. 
Born of the laughing lightning, may the Maruts guard us everywhere 
May they be gracious unto Us. 
Like some lost animal, drive to us, bright Pusan, him who bears up heaven, 
Resting on many-coloured grass. 
Pusan the Bright has found the King, concealed and bidden in a cave, 
Who rests on grass of many hues. 
And may he. duly bring to me the six bound closely, through these drops, 
As one who ploughs with steers brings corn. 
Along their paths the Mothers go, Sisters of priestly ministrants, 
Mingling their sweetness with the milk. 
May Waters gathered near the Sun, and those wherewith the Sun is joined, 
Speed forth this sacrifice of ours. 
call the Waters, Goddesses, wherein our cattle quench their thirst; 
Oblations to the Streams be given. 
A m l it is in the Waters in the Waters there is healing balm 
Be swift, ye Gods, to give them praise. 
Within the Waters-Soma thus hath told me-dwell all balms that heal, 
And Agni, he who blesseth all. The Waters hold all medicines. 
Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm. 
So that 1 long may see the Sun. 
Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought. 
If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me. 
The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come: 
O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me. 
Fill me with splendour, Agni; give offspring and length of days; the Gods 
Shall know me even as I am, and Indra with the Rsis, know. 
WHO now is he, what God among Immortals, of whose auspicious name we may bethink us? 
Who shall to mighty Aditi restore us, that I may see my Father and my Mother? 
Agni the God the first among the Immortals, - of his auspicious name let us bethink us. 
He shall to mighty Aditi restore us, that I may see my Father and my Mother. 
To thee, O Savitar, the Lord of precious things, who helpest us 
Continually, for our share we come- 
Wealth, highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it, which is laid, 
Free from all hatred, in thy hands 
Through thy protection may we come to even the height of affluence 
Which Bhaga hath dealt out to us. 
Ne'er have those birds that fly through air attained to thy high dominion or thy might or spirit; 
Nor these the waters that flow on for ever, nor hills, abaters of the wind's wild fury. 
Its rays, whose root is high above, stream downward. Deep may they sink within us, and be hidden. 
King Varuna hath made a spacious pathway, a pathway for the Sun wherein to travel. 
Where no way was he made him set his footstep, and warned afar whate'er afflicts the spirit. 
A hundred balms are thine, O King, a thousand; deep and wide-reaching also be thy favours. 
Far from us, far away drive thou Destruction. Put from us e'en the sin we have committed. 
Whither by day depart the constellations that shine at night, set high in heaven above us? 
ask this of thee with my prayer adoring; thy worshipper craves this with his oblation. 
Nightly and daily this one thing they tell me, this too the thought of mine own heart repeateth. 
May he to whom prayed fettered Sunahsepa, may he the Sovran Varuna release us. 
Bound to three pillars captured Sunahsepa thus to the Aditya made his supplication. 
Him may the Sovran Varuna deliver, wise, ne'er deceived, loosen the bonds that bind him. 
With bending down, oblations, sacrifices, O Varuna, we deprecate thine anger: 
Wise Asura, thou King of wide dominion, loosen the bonds of sins by us committed. 
Loosen the bonds, O Varuna, that hold me, loosen the bonds above, between, and under. 
So in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O thou Aditya. 
WHATEVER law of thine, O God, O Varurna, as we are men, 
Day after day we violate. 
give us not as a prey to death, to be destroyed by thee in wrath. 
To thy fierce anger when displeased. 
To gain thy mercy, Varuna, with hymns we bind thy heart, as binds 
The charioteer his tethered horse. 
They flee from me dispirited, bent only on obtaining wealths 
As to their nests the birds of air. 
When shall we bring, to be appeased, the Hero, Lord of warrior might, 
Him, the far-seeing Varuna? 
This, this with joy they both accept in common: never do they fail 
The ever-faithful worshipper. 
He knows the path of birds that fly through heaven, and, Sovran of the sea, 
He knows the ships that are thereon. 
True to his holy law, he knows the twelve moons with their progeny: 
He knows the moon of later birth. 
He knows the pathway of the wind, the spreading, high, and mighty wind 
He knows the Gods who dwell above. 
Most wise, sits there to govern, all. 
From thence percerving he beholds all wondrous things, both what hath been, 
And what hereafter will be done. 
May that Aditya, very -wise, make fair paths for us all our days: 
May lie prolong our lives for us. 
His spies are seated found about. 
The God whom enemies threaten not, nor those who tyrannize o'er men, 
Nor those whose minds are bent on wrong. 
He who gives glory to mankind, not glory that is incomplete, 
To our own bodies giving it. 
Yearning for the wide-seeing One, my thoughts move onward unto him. 
As kine unto their pastures move. 
Once more together let us speak, because my meath is brought: priest-like 
Thou eatest what is dear to thee. 
Now saw I him whom all may see, 1 saw his car above the earth: 
He hath accepted these my songs. 
Longing for help 1 cried to thee. 
Thou. O wise God, art Lord of all, thou art the King of earth and heaven 
Hear, as thou goest on thy way. 
Release us from the upper bond, untie the bond between, and loose 
The bonds below, that 1 may live. 
O WORTHY of oblation, Lord of prospering powers, assume thy robes, 
And offer this our sacrifice. 
Sit ever to be chosen, as our Priest., most youthful, through our hymns, 
O Agni, through our heavenly word. 
For here a Father for his son, Kinsman for kinsman worshippeth. 
And Friend, choice-worthy, for his friend. 
Fiere let the foe-destroyers sit, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, 
Like men, upon our sacred grass. 
O ancient Herald, be thou glad in this our rite and fellowship: 
Hearken thou well to these our songs. 
Whate'er in this perpetual course we sacrifice to God and God, 
That gift is offered up in thee 
May he be our deal - household Lord, Priest, pleasant and, choice-worthy may 
We, with bright fires, be dear to him. 
The Gods, adored with brilliant fires, have granted precious wealth to us 
So, with bright fires, we pray to thee. 
And, O Immortal One, so may the eulogies of mortal men 
Belong to us and thee alike. 
With all thy fires, O Agni, find pleasure in this our sacrifice, 
And this our speech, O Son of Strength. 
WITH worship will I glorify thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed, 
Imperial Lord of sacred rites. 
May the far-striding Son of Strength, bringer of great felicity, 
Who pours his gifts like rain, be ours. 
Lord of all life, from near; from far, do thou, O Agni evermore 
Protect us from the sinful man. 
O Agni, graciously announce this our oblation to the Gods, 
And this our newest song of praise. 
Give us a share of strength most high, a share of strength that is below, 
A share of strength that is between. 
Thou dealest gifts, resplendent One; nigh, as with waves of Sindhu, thou 
Swift streamest to the worshipper. 
That man is lord of endless strength whom thou protectest in the fight, 
Agni, or urgest to the fray. 
Him, whosoever he may be, no man may vanquish, mighty One: 
Nay, very glorious power is his. 
May he who dwells with all mankind bear us with war-steeds through the fight. 
And with the singers win the spoil. 
Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, this eulogy to Rudra, him 
Adorable in every house. 
May this our God, great, limitless, smoke-bannered excellently bright. 
Urge us to strength and holy thought. 
Like some rich Lord of men may he, Agni the banner of the Gods, 
Refulgent, hear us through our lauds. 
Glory to Gods, the mighty and the lesser glory to Gods the younger and the elder! 
Let us, if we have power, pay the God worship: no better prayer than this, ye Gods, acknowledge. 
THERE where the broad-based stone raised on high to press the juices out, 
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds. 
Where, like broad hips, to hold the juice the platters of the press are laid, 
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds. 
There where the woman marks and leans the pestle's constant rise and fall, 
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds. 
Where, as with reins to guide a horse, they bind the churning-staff with cords, 
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds. 
If of a truth in every house, O Mortar thou art set for work. 
Here give thou forth thy clearest sound, loud as the drum of conquerors. 
O Sovran of the Forest, as the wind blows soft in front of thee, 
Mortar, for Indra press thou forth the Soma juice that he may drink. 
Best strength-givers, ye stretch wide jaws, O Sacrificial Implements, 
Like two bay horses champing herbs. 
Ye Sovrans of the Forest, both swift, with swift pressers press to-day 
Sweet Soma juice for Indra's drink. 
Take up in beakers what remains: the Soma on the filter pour, 
and on the ox-hide set the dregs. 
O SOMA DRINKER, ever true, utterly hopeless though we be. 
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
O Lord of Strength, whose jaws are strong, great deeds are thine, the powerful: 
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
Lull thou asleep, to wake no more, the pair who on each other look 
Do thou, O Indra, give us, help of beauteous horses and of kine, 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
Hero, let hostile spirits sleep, and every gentler genius wake: 
Do thou, O Indra,. give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
Destroy this ass, O Indra, who in tones discordant brays to thee: 
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
Far distant on the forest fall the tempest in a circling course! 
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
Slay each reviler, and destroy him who in secret injures us: 
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine 
In thousands, O most wealthy One. 
WE seeking strength with Soma-drops fill full your Indra like a well, 
Most liberal, Lord of Hundred Powers, 
Who lets a hundred of the pure, a thousand of the milk-blent draughts 
Flow, even as down a depth, to him; 
When for the strong, the rapturous joy he in this manner hath made room 
Within his belly, like the sea. 
This is thine own. Thou drawest near, as turns a pigeon to his mate: 
Thou carest too for this our prayer. 
O Hero, Lord of Bounties, praised in hymns, may power and joyfulness 
Be his who sings the laud to thee. 
Lord of a Hundred Powers, stand up to lend us succour in this fight 
In others too let us agree. 
In every need, in every fray we call as friends to succour us 
Indra the mightiest of all. 
If he will hear us let him come with succour of a thousand kinds, 
And all that strengthens, to our call. 
Thee whom my sire invoked of old. 
We pray to thee, O much-invoked, rich in all precious gifts, O Friend, 
Kind God to those who sing thy praise. 
llO Soma-drinker, Thunder-armed, Friend of our lovely-featured dames 
And of our Soma-drinking friends. 
Thus, Soma-drinker, may it be; thus, Friend, who wieldest thunder, act 
To aid each wish as we desire. 
With Indra splendid feasts be ours, rich in all strengthening things wherewith. 
Wealthy in food, we may rejoice. 
Like thee, thyself, the singers' Friend, thou mo vest, as it were, besought. 
Bold One, the axle of the car. 
That, Satakratu, thou to grace and please thy praisers, as it were, 
Stirrest the axle with thy strength. 
With champing, neighing loudly-snorting horses Indra hath ever won himself great treasures 
A car of gold hath he whose deeds are wondrous received from us, and let us too receive it. 
Come, Asvins, with enduring strength wealthy in horses and in kine, 
And gold, O ye of wondrous deeds. 
Your chariot yoked for both alike, immortal, ye of mighty acts, 
Travels, O Aivins, in the sea. 
High on the forehead of the Bull one chariot wheel ye ever keep, 
The other round the sky revolves. 
What mortal, O immortal Dawn, enjoyeth thee? Where lovest thou? 
To whom, O radiant, dost thou go? 
For we have had thee in our thoughts whether anear or far away, 
Red-hued and like a dappled mare. 
Hither, O Daughter of the Sky, come thou with these thy strengthenings, 
And send thou riches down to us. 
Thou, Agni, wast the earliest Angiras, a Seer; thou wast, a God thyself, the Gods' auspicious Friend. 
After thy holy ordinance the Maruts, sage, active through wisdom, -with their glittering spears, were born 
O Agni, thou, the best and earliest Angiras, fulfillest as a Sage the holy law of Gods. 
Sprung from two mothers, wise, through all existence spread, resting in many a place for sake of living m 
an. 
To Matarisvan first thou, Agni, wast disclosed, and to Vivasvan through thy noble inward power. 
Heaven and Earth, Vasu! shook at the choosing of the Priest: the burthen thou didst bear, didst worship 
mighty Gods. 
Agni thou madest heaven to thunder for mankind; thou, yet more pious, for pious Pururavas. 
When thou art rapidly freed from thy parents, first eastward they bear thee round, and, after, to the west. 
Thou, Agni, art a Bull who makes our store increase, to be invoked by him who lifts the ladle up. 
Well knowing the oblation with the hallowing word, uniting all who live, thou lightenest first our folk 
Agni, thou savest in the synod when pursued e’en him, farseeing One! who walks in evil ways. 
Thou, when the heroes fight for spoil which men rush, round, slayest in war the many by the hands of few 
For glory, Agni, day by day, thou liftest up the mortal man to highest immortality, 
Even thou who yearning for both races givest them great bliss, and to the prince grantest abundant food. 
O Agni, highly lauded, make our singer famous that he may win us store of riches: 
May we improve the rite with new performance. O Earth and Heaven, with all the Gods, protect us. 
O blameless Agni lying in thy Parents' lap, a God among the Gods, be watchful for our good. 
Former of bodies, be the singer's Providence: all good things hast thou sown for him, auspicious One! 
Agni, thou art our Providence, our Father thou - we are thy brethren and thou art our spring of life, in 
thee, rich in good heroes, guard of high decrees, meet hundred, thousand treasures, O infallible! 
Thee, Agni, have the Gods made the first living One for living man, Lord of the house of Nahusa. 
Ila they made the teacher of the sons of men, what time a Son was born to the father of my race. 
Worthy to be revered, O Agni, God, preserve our wealthy patrons with thy succours, and ourselves. 
Guard of our seed art thou, aiding our cows to bear, incessantly protecting in thy holy way. 
Agni, thou art a guard close to the pious man; kindled art thou, four-eyed! for him who is unarmed. 
With fond heart thou acceptest e'en the poor man's prayer, when he hath brought his gift to gain security. 
Thou, Agni gainest for the loudly-praising priest the highest wealth, the object of a man's desire. 
Thou art called Father, caring even for the weak, and wisest, to the simple one thou teachest lore. 
Agni, the man who giveth guerdon to the priests, like well-sewn armour thou guardest on every side. 
He who with grateful food shows kindness in his house, an offerer to the living, is the type of heaven. 
Pardon, we pray, this sin of ours, O Agni, — the path which we have trodden, widely straying, 
Dear Friend and Father, caring for the pious, who speedest nigh and who inspirest mortals. 
As erst to Manus, to Yayiti, Angiras, so Angiras! pure Agni! come thou to our hall 
Bring hither the celestial host and seat them here upon the sacred grass, and offer what they love. 
By this our prayer be thou, O Agni, strengthened, prayer made by us after our power and knowledge. 
Lead thou us, therefore, to increasing riches; endow us with thy strength-bestowing favour. 
WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, the Thunder-wielder. 
He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents. 
He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder Tvastar fashioned. 
Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean. 
Impetuous as a bull, he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices. 
Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons. 
When, Indra, thou hadst slain the dragon's firstborn, and overcome the charms of the enchanters, 
Then, giving life to Sun and Dawn and Heaven, thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee. 
Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vrtra, worst of Vrtras. 
As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the earth so lies the prostrate Dragon. 
He, like a mad weak warrior, challenged Indra, the great impetuous many-slaying Hero. 
He. brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed-Indra's foe-the shattered forts in falling. 
Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders. 
Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus Vrtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered. 
There as he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow above him. 
The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which Vrtra with his greatness had encompassed. 
Then humbled was the strength of Vrtra's mother: Indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her. 
The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay Danu. 
Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward. 
The waters bear off Vrtra's nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to during darkness. 
Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dasas, the waters stayed like kine held by the robber. 
But he, when he had smitten Vrtra, opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned. 
A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second, 
Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers. 
Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist which had spread around him: 
When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Maghavan gained the victory for ever. 
Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain hi 
m; 
That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst nine-and-ninety flowing rivers? 
Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and horned, the Thunder-wielder. 
Over all living men he rules as Sovran, containing all as spokes within the felly. 
Come, fain for booty let us seek to Indra: yet more shall he increase his care that guides us. 
Will not the Indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth, of cattle? 
fly to him invisible Wealth-giver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie, 
With fairest hymns of praise adoring Indra, whom those who laud him must invoke in battle. 
Mid all his host, he bindeth on the quiver he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth: 
Gathering up great store of riches, Indra. be thou no trafficker with us, most mighty. 
Thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy Dasyu, alone, yet going with thy helpers, Indra! 
Far from the floor of heaven in all directions, the ancient riteless ones fled to destruction. 
Fighting with pious worshippers, the riteless turned and fled, Indra! with averted faces. 
When thou, fierce Lord of the Bay Steeds, the Stayer, blewest from earth and heaven and sky the godless. 
They met in fight the army of the blameless, then the Navagvas put forth all their power. 
They, like emasculates with men contending, fled, conscious, by steep paths from Indra, scattered. 
Whether they weep or laugh, thou hast o'erthrown them, O Indra, on the sky's extremest limit. 
The Dasyu thou hast burned from heaven, and welcomed the prayer of him who pours the juice and lauds 
thee. 
Adorned with their array of gold and jewels, they o'er the earth a covering veil extended. 
Although they hastened, they o'ercame not Indra: their spies he compassed with the Sun of morning. 
As thou enjoyest heaven and earth. O Indra, on every side surrounded with thy greatness, 
So thou with priests bast blown away the Dasyu, and those who worship not with those who worship. 
They who pervaded earth's extremest limit subdued not with their charms the Wealth-bestower: 
Indra, the Bull, made his ally the thunder, and with its light milked cows from out the darkness. 
The waters flowed according to their nature; he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty. 
Then Indra, with his spirit concentrated, smote him for ever with his strongest weapon. 
Indra broke through Ilibisa's strong castles, and Suspa with his horn he cut to pieces: 
Thou, Maghavan, for all his might and swiftness, slewest thy fighting foeman with thy thunder 
Fierce on his enemies fell Indra's weapon: with, his shaip bull he rent their forts in pieces. 
He with his thunderbolt dealt blows on Vrtra; and conquered, executing all his purpose. 
Indra, thou helpest Kutsa whom thou lovedst, and guardedst brave Dagadyu when he battled, 
The dust of trampling horses rose to heaven, and Svitri's son stood up again for conquest. 
Svitra's mild steer, O Maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land, mid Tugra's houses. 
Long stood they there before the task was ended: thou wast the master of the foemen's treasure. 
Ye who observe this day be with us even thrice: far-stretching is you bounty, Asvins and your course. 
To you, as to a cloak in winter, we cleave close: you are to be drawn nigh unto us by the wise. 
Three are the fellies in your honey-bearing car, that travels after Soma's loved one, as all know. 
Three are the pillars set upon it for support: thrice journey ye by night, O Asvins, thrice by day. 
Thrice in the self-same day, ye Gods who banish want, sprinkle ye thrice to-day our sacrifice with mea 
th; 
And thrice vouchsafe us store of food with plenteous strength, at evening, O ye Asvins, and at break of da 
y- 
Thrice come ye to our home, thrice to the righteous folk, thrice triply aid the man who well deserves your 
help. 
Thrice, O ye Asvins, bring us what shall make us glad; thrice send us store of food as nevermore to fail. 
Thrice, O ye Asvins, bring to us abundant wealth: thrice in the Gods' assembly, thrice assist our thought 
s. 
Thrice, grant ye us prosperity, thrice grant us fame; for the Sun's daughter hath mounted your three-wheeled 
car. 
Thrice, Asvins, grant to us the heavenly medicines, thrice those of earth and thrice those that the waters 
hold, 
Favour and health and strength bestow upon my son; triple protection, Lords of Splendour, grant to him. 
Thrice are ye to be worshipped day by day by us: thrice, O ye Asvins, ye travel around the earth. 
Car-bome from far away, O ye Nasatyas, come, like vital air to bodies, come ye to the three. 
Thrice, O ye Asvins, with the Seven Mother Streams; three are the jars, the triple offering is prepared. 
Three are the worlds, and moving on above the sky ye guard the firm-set vault of heaven through days and 
nights. 
Where are the three wheels of your triple chariot, where are the three seats thereto firmly fastened? 
When will ye yoke the mighty ass that draws it, to bring you to our sacrifice. Nasatyas? 
Nasatyas, come: the sacred gift is offered up; drink the sweet juice with lips that know the sweetness w 
ell. 
Savitar sends, before the dawn of day, your car, fraught with oil, various-coloured, to our sacrifice. 
Come, O Nasatyas, with the thrice-eleven Gods; come, O ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath. 
Make long our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off our enemies; be with us evermore. 
Borne in your triple car, O Asvins, bring us present prosperity with noble offspring. 
AGNI 1 first invoke for our prosperity; I call on Mitra, Varuna, to aid us here. 
call on Night who gives rest to all moving life; I call on Savitar the God to lend us help. 
Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest the immortal and the mortal, 
Borne in his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God who looks on every creature. 
The God moves by the upward path, the downward; with two bright Bays, adorable, he journeys. 
Savitar comes, the God from the far distance, and chases from us all distress and sorrow. 
His chariot decked with pearl, of various colours, lofty, with golden pole, the God hath mounted, 
The many-rayed One, Savitar the holy, bound, bearing power and might, for darksome regions. 
Drawing the gold-yoked car his Bays, white-footed, have manifested light to all the peoples. 
Held in the lap of Savitar, divine One, all men, all beings have their place for ever. 
Three heavens there are; two Savitar's, adjacent: in Yama's world is one, the home of heroes, 
As on a linch-pin, firm, rest things immortal: he who hath known it let him here declare it. 
He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering Asura, the gentle Leader. 
Where now is Surya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his ray hath wandered? 
The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert regions and the Seven Rivers. 
God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto him who worships. 
The golden-handed Savitar, far-seeing, goes on his way between the earth and heaven, 
Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright sky through the darksome region. 
May he, gold-handed Asura, kind Leader, come hither to us with his help and favour. 
Driving off Raksasas and Yatudhanas, the God is present, praised in hymns at evening. 
llO Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established in the air's midregion: 
O God, come by those paths so fair to travel, preserve thou us from harm this day, and bless us. 
WITH words sent forth in holy hymns, Agni we supplicate, the Lord Of 
many families who duly serve the Gods, yea, him whom others also praise. 
Men have won Agni, him who makes their strength abound: we, with oblations, worship thee. 
Our gracious-minded Helper in our deeds of might, be thou, O Excellent, this day. 
Thee for our messenger we choose, thee, the Omniscient, for our Priest. 
The flames of thee the mighty are spread wide around: thy splendour reaches to the sky. 
The Gods enkindle thee their ancient messenger, - Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman. 
That mortal man, O Agni, gains through thee all wealth, who hath poured offerings unto thee. 
Thou, Agni, art a cheering Priest, Lord of the House, men's messenger: 
All constant high decrees established by the Gods, gathered together, meet in thee. 
In thee, the auspicious One, O Agni, youthfullest, each sacred gift is offered up: 
This day, and after, gracious, worship thou our Gods, that we may have heroic sons. 
To him in his own splendour bright draw near in worship the devout. 
Men kindle Agni with their sacrificial gifts, victorious o'er the enemies. 
The glorious Bull, invoked, hath stood at Kanva's side: loud neighed the Steed in frays for kine. 
Seat thee, for thou art mighty; shine, best entertainer of the Gods. 
Worthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke, ruddy and beautiful to see. 
Bearer of offerings, whom, best sacrificing Priest, the Gods for Manu's sake ordained; 
Whom Kanva, whom Medhyatithi made the source of wealth, and Vrsan and Upastuta. 
Him, Agni, whom Medhyatithi, whom Kanva kindled for his rite, 
Him these our songs of praise, him, Agni, we extol: his powers shine out preeminent. 
Make our wealth perfect thou, O Agni, Lord divine: for thou hast kinship with the Gods. 
Thou rulest as a King o'er widely-famous strength: be good to us, for thou art great. 
Stand up erect to lend us aid, stand up like Savitar the God: 
Erect as strength-bestower we call aloud, with unguents and with priests, on thee. 
Erect, preserve us from sore trouble; with thy flame burn thou each ravening demon dead. 
Raise thou us up that we may walk and live, so thou shalt find our worship mid the Gods. 
Preserve us, Agni, from the fiend, preserve us from malicious wrong. 
Save us from him who fain would injure us or slay. Most Youthful, thou with lofty light. 
Smite down as with a club, thou who hast fire for teeth, smite thou the wicked, right and left. 
Let not the man who plots against us in the night, nor any foe prevail o'er us. 
Agni hath given heroic might to Kainva, and felicity: 
Agni hath helped our friends, hath helped Medhyitithi, hath helped Upastuta to win. 
We call on Ugradeva, Yadu, Turvasa, by means of Agni, from afar; 
Agni, bring Navavastva and Brhadratba, Turviti, to subdue the foe. 
Manu hath stablished thee a light, Agni, for all the race of men: 
Sprung from the Law, oil-fed, for Kanva hast thou blazed, thou whom the people reverence. 
The flames of Agni full of splendour and of might are fearful, not to be approached. 
Consume for ever all demons and sorcerers, consume thou each devouring fiend. 
SING forth, 0 Kanvas, to your band of Maruts unassailable, 
Sporting, resplendent on their car 
They who, self-luminous, were born together, with the spotted deer, 
Spears, swords, and glittering ornaments. 
One hears, as though 'twere close at hand, the cracking of the whips they hold 
They gather glory on their way. 
Now sing ye forth the God-given hymn to your exultant Marut host. 
The fiercely-vigorous, the strong. 
Praise ye the Bull among the cows; for 'tis the Maruts' sportive band: 
It strengthened as it drank the rain. 
Who is your mightiest, Heroes, when, O shakers of the earth and heaven, 
Ye shake them like a garment's hem? 
At your approach man holds him down before the fury of your wrath: 
The rugged-jointed mountain yields. 
They at whose racings forth the earth, like an age-weakened lord of men, 
Trembles in terror on their ways. 
Strong is their birth: vigour have they to issue from their Mother; strength. 
Yea, even twice enough, is theirs. 
And these, the Sons, the Singers, in their racings have enlarged the bounds, 
So that the kine must walk knee-deep. 
Before them, on the ways they go, they drop this offspring of the cloud, 
Long, broad, and inexhaustible. 
O Maruts, as your strength is great, so have ye cast men down on earth. 
So have ye made the mountains fall. 
The while the Maruts pass along, they talk together on the way: 
Doth any hear them as they speak? 
Come quick with swift steeds, for ye have worshippers among Kanva’s sons 
May you rejoice among them well. 
All is prepared for your delight. We are their servants evermore, 
To live as long as life may last. 
WHAT now? When will ye take us by both hands, as a dear sire his son, 
Gods, for whom sacred grass is clipped? 
Now whither? To what goal of yours go ye in heaven, and not on earth? 
Where do your cows disport themselves? 
Where are your newest favours shown? Where, Maruts, your prosperity? 
Where all your high felicities? 
If, O ye Maruts, ye the Sons whom Prsni bore, were mortal, and 
Immortal he who sings your praise. 
Then never were your praiser loathed like a wild beast in pasture-land. 
Nor should he go on Yama's path. 
Let not destructive plague on plague hard to be conquered, strike its down: 
Let each, with drought, depart from us. 
Truly, they the fierce and mighty Sons of Rudra send their windless 
Rain e'en on the desert places. 
Like a cow the lightning lows and follows, motherlike, her youngling, 
When their rain-flood hath been loosened. 
When they inundate the earth they spread forth darkness e'en in day time, 
With the water-laden rain-cloud. 
O Maruts, at your voice's sound this earthly habitation shakes, 
And each man reels who dwells therein. 
Maruts, with your strong-hoofed steeds, unhindered in their courses, haste 
Along the bright embanked streams. 
Firm be the fellies of your wheels, steady your horses and your cars, 
And may your reins be fashioned well. 
Invite thou hither with this song, for praise, Agni the Lord of Prayer, 
Him who is fair as Mitra is. 
Form in thy mouth the hymn of praise expand thee like, a rainy cloud 
Sing forth the measured eulogy. 
Sing glory to the Marut host, praiseworthy, tuneful, vigorous: 
Here let the Strong Ones dwell with us. 
WHEN thus, like flame, from far away, Maruts, ye cast your measure forth. 
To whom go Ye, to whom, O shakers of the earth, moved by whose wisdom, whose design? 
Strong let your weapons be to drive away your foes, firm for resistance let them be. 
Yea, passing glorious must be your warrior might, not as a guileful mortal's strength. 
When what is strong ye overthrow, and whirl about each ponderous thing. 
Heroes, your course is through the forest trees of earth, and through the fissures of the rocks. 
Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth: 
Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now. 
They make the mountains rock and reel, they rend the forest-kings apart. 
onward, ye Maruts, drive, like creatures drunk with wine, ye, Gods with all your company. 
Ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer: a red deer, as a leader, draws. 
Even the Earth herself listened as ye came near, and men were sorely terrified. 
O Rudras, quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours. 
Come to us with your aid as in the days of old, so now for frightened Kanva's sake. 
Should any monstrous foe, O Maruts, sent by you or sent by mortals threaten us, 
Tear ye him from us with your power and with your might, and with the succours that are yours. 
For ye, the worshipful and wise, have guarded Kanva perfectly. 
O Maruts, come to us with full protecting help, as lightning flashes seek the rain. 
Whole strength have ye, O Bounteous Ones; perfect, earth-shakers, is your might. 
Maruts, against the poet's wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart. 
O BRAMANASPATI, stand up: God-serving men we pray to thee. 
May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra, most swift, be thou with them. 
O Son of Strength, each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of battle waits for him. 
O Maruts, may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds and hero might. 
May Brahmanaspati draw nigh, may Sunrta the Goddess come, 
And Gods bring to this rite which gives the five-fold gift the Hero, lover of mankind. 
He who bestows a noble guerdon on the priest wins fame that never shall decay. 
For him we offer sacred hero-giving food, peerless and conquering easily. 
Now Brahmanaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise, 
Wherein Indra and Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods, have made their dwelling place. 
May we in holy synods, Gods! recite that hymn, peerless, that brings felicity. 
If you, O Heroes, graciously accept this word, may it obtain all bliss from you. 
Who shall approach the pious? who the man whose sacred grass is trimmed? 
The offerer with his folk advances more and more: he fills his house with precious things. 
He amplifies his lordly might, with kings he slays: e'en mid alarms he dwells secure 
In great or lesser fight none checks him, none subdues, -the wielder of the thunderbolt. 
NE'ER is he injured whom the Gods Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, 
The excellently wise, protect. 
He prospers ever, free from scathe, whom they, as with full hands, enrich. 
Whom they preserve from every foe. 
The Kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies, 
And lead him safely o'er distress. 
Thornless, Adityas, is the path, easy for him who seeks the Law: 
With him is naught to anger you. 
What sacrifice, Adityas, ye Heroes guide by the path direct, - 
May that come nigh unto your thought. 
That mortal, ever unsubdued, gains wealth and every precious thing, 
And children also of his own. 
How, my friends, shall we prepare Aryaman's and Mitra's laud, 
Glorious food of Varuna? 
point not out to you a man who strikes the pious, or reviles: 
Only with hymns I call you nigh. 
Let him not love to speak ill words: but fear the One who holds all four 
Within his hand, until they fall. 
SHORTEN our ways, O Pusan, move aside obstruction in the path: 
Go close before us, cloud-bom God. 
Drive, Pusan, from our road the wolf, the wicked inauspicious wolf, 
Who lies in Wait to injure us. 
Who lurks about the path we take, the robber with a guileful heart: 
Far from the road chase him away. 
Tread with thy foot and trample out the firebrand of the wicked one, 
The double-tongued, whoe'er he be. 
Wise Pusan, Wonder-Worker, we claim of thee now the aid wherewith 
Thou furtheredst our sires of old. 
So, Lord of all prosperity, best wielder of the golden sword, 
Make riches easy to be won. 
Past all pursuers lead us, make pleasant our path and fair to tread: 
O Pusan, find thou power for this. 
Lead us to meadows rich in grass: send on our way no early heat: 
O Pusan, find thou power for this. 
Be gracious to us, fill us full, give, feed us, and invigorate: 
O Pusan, find thou power for this. 
No blame have we for Pusan; him we magnify with songs of praise: 
We seek the Mighty One for wealth. 
WHAT shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise, 
That shall be dearest to his heart? 
That Aditi may grant the grace of Rudra to our folk, our kine, 
Our cattle and our progeny; 
That Mitra and that Varuna, that Rudra may remember us, 
Yea, all the Gods with one accord. 
To Rudra Lord of sacrifice, of hymns and balmy medicines, 
We pray for joy and health and strength. 
He shines in splendour like the Sun, refulgent as bright gold is he. 
The good, the best among the Gods. 
May he grant health into our steeds, wellbeing to our rams and ewes, 
To men, to women, and to kine. 
O Soma, set thou upon us the glory of a hundred men, 
The great renown of mighty chiefs. 
Let not malignities, nor those who trouble Soma, hinder us. 
Indu, give us a share of strength. 
Soma! head, central point, love these; Soma! know these as serving thee, 
Children of thee Immortal, at the highest place of holy law. 
IMMORTAL Jatavedas, thou many-hued fulgent gift of Dawn, 
Agni, this day to him who pays oblations bring the Gods who waken with the morn. 
For thou art offering-bearer and loved messenger, the charioteer of sacrifice: 
Accordant with the Asvins and with Dawn grant us heroic strength and lofty fame. 
As messenger we choose to-day Agni the good whom many love, 
Smoke-bannered spreader of the light, at break of day glory of sacrificial rites. 
Him noblest and most youthful, richly worshipped guest, dear to the men who offer gifts, 
Him, Agni Jatavedas, I beseech at dawn that he may bring the Gods to us. 
Thee, Agni, will I glorify, deathless nourisher of the world, 
Immortal, offering-bearer, meet for sacred food, preserver, best at sacrifice. 
Tell good things to thy praiser, O most youthful God, as richly worshipped, honey-tongued. 
And, granting to Praskanva lengthened days of life, show honour to the Heavenly Host. 
For the men, Agni, kindle thee as all possessor and as Priest; 
So Agni, much-invoked, bring hither with all speed the Gods, the excellently wise, 
At dawn of day, at night, Usas and Savitar, the Asvins, Bhaga, Agni's self: 
Skilled in fair rites, with Soma poured, the Kanvas light thee, the oblation-wafting God. 
For, Agni, Lord of sacrifice and messenger of men art thou: 
Bring thou the Gods who wake at dawn who see the light, this day to drink the Soma juice. 
Thou shonest forth, O Agni, after former dawns, all visible, O rich in light. 
Thou art our help in battle-strife, the Friend of inan, the great high priest in sacrifice. 
Like Manu, we will stablish thee, Agni, performer of the rite, 
Invoker, ministering Priest, exceeding wise, the swift immortal messenger. 
When as the Gods' High Priest, by many loved, thou dost their mission as their nearest Friend, 
Then, like the far-resounding billows of the flood, thy flames, O Agni, roar aloud. 
Heat-, Agni, who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of escort Gods; 
Let Mitra, Aryaman,- seeking betimes our rite, seat them upon the sacred grass. 
Let those who strengthen Law, who bountiUly give, the life-tongued Maruts, hear our praise. 
May Law-supporting Varuna with the Asvins twain and Usas, drink the Soma juice. 
WORSHIP the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras, the Adityas, all Who spring from Manu, those who know 
fair rites, who pour their blessings down. 
Agni, the Gods who understand give ear unto the worshipper: 
Lord of Red Steeds, who lovest song, bring thou those Three-and-Thirty Gods. 
O Jatavedas, great in act, hearken thou to Praskanva's call, 
As Priyamedha erst was heard, Atri, Virupa, Angiras. 
The sons of Priyamedha skilled in lofty praise have called for help 
On Agni who with fulgent flame is Ruler of all holy rites. 
Hear thou, invoked withholy oil, bountiful giver of rewards, 
These eulogies, whereby the sons of Kanva call thee to their aid. 
O Agni, loved by many, thou of fame most wondrous, in their homes 
Men call on thee whose hair is flame, to be the bearer of their gifts. 
Thee, Agni, best to find out wealth, most widely famous, quick to hear, 
Singers have stablished in their rites Herald and ministering Priest. 
Singers with Soma pressed have made thee, Agni, hasten to the feast, 
Great light to mortal worshipper, what time they bring the sacred gift. 
Good, bounteous, Son of Strength, this day seat here on sacred grass the Gods 
Who come at early morn, the host of heaven, to drink the Soma juice 
Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host: 
Here stands the Soma, bounteous Gods drink this expressed ere yesterday. 
Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear Daughter of the Sky: 
High, Asvins, I extol your praise, 
Sons of the Sea, mighty to save discoverers of riches, ye 
Gods with deep thought who find out wealth. 
Your giant coursers hasten on over the region all in flames, - 
When your car flies with winged steeds. 
He, liberal, lover of the flood, Lord of the House, the vigilant. 
Chiefs! with oblations feeds you full. 
Ye have regard unto our hymns, Nasatyas, thinking of our words: 
Drink boldly of the Soma juice. 
May through the darkness carry us. 
Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore 
O Asvins, harness ye the car. 
The heaven's wide vessel is your own on the flood's shore your chariot waits 
Drops, with the hymn, have been prepared. 
Kanvas, the drops are in the heaven; the wealth is at the waters' place: 
Where will ye manifest your form? 
Light came to lighten up the branch, the Sun appeared as it were gold: 
And with its-tongue shone forth the dark. 
The path of sacrifice was made to travel to the farther goal: 
The road of heaven was manifest. 
The singer of their praise awaits whatever grace the Asvins give, 
who save when Soma gladdens them. 
Ye dwellers with Vivasvan come, auspicious, as to Manu erst; 
come to the Soma and our praise. 
O circumambient Asvins, Dawn follows the brightness of your way: 
Approve with beams our solemn rites. 
Drink ye of our libations, grant protection, O ye Asvins Twain, 
With aids which none may interrupt. 
ASVINS, for you who strengthen Law this sweetest Soma hath been shed. 
Drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers it. 
Come, O ye Asvins, mounted on your triple car three-seated, beautiful of form 
To you at sacrifice the Kanvas send the prayer: graciously listen to their call. 
O Asvins, ye who strengthen Law, drink ye this sweetest Soma juice. 
Borne on your wealth-fraught car come ye this day to him who offers, ye of wondrous deeds. 
Omniscient Asvins, on the thrice-heaped grass bedew with the sweet juice the sacrifice. 
The sons of Kanva, striving heavenward, call on you with draughts of Soma juice out-poured. 
O Asvins, with those aids wherewith ye guarded Kanva carefully, 
Keep us, O hords of Splendour: drink the Soma juice, ye strengthened of holy law. 
O Mighty Ones, ye gave Sudas abundant food, brought on your treasure-laden car; 
So now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave, either from heaven or from the sea. 
Nasatyas, whether ye be far away or close to Turvasa, 
Borne on your lightly-rolling chariot come to us, together with the sunbeams come. 
So let your coursers, ornaments of sacrifice, bring you to our libations here. 
Bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright, sit. Chiefs, upon the sacred grass. 
Come, O Nasatyas, on your car decked with a sunbright canopy. 
Whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper, to drink the Soma's pleasant juice. 
With lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us, that they, most rich, may succour us; 
For ye have ever in the Kanvas' well-loved house, O Asvins, drunk the Soma juice. 
DAWN on us with prosperity, O Usas, Daughter of the Sky, 
Dawn with great glory, Goddess, Lady of the Light, dawn thou with riches. Bounteous One. 
They, bringing steeds and kine, boon-givers of all wealth, have oft sped forth to lighten us. 
O Usas, waken up for me the sounds of joy: send us the riches of the great. 
Usas hath dawned, and now shall dawn, the Goddess, driver forth of cars 
Which, as she cometh nigh, have fixed their thought on her, like glory-seekers on the flood. 
Here Kanva, chief of Kanva's race, sings forth aloud the glories of the heroes' names, - 
The. princes who, O Usas, as thou comest near, direct their thoughts to liberal gifts. 
Like a good matron Usas comes carefully tending everything: 
Rousing all life she stirs all creatures that have feet, and makes the birds of air fly up. 
She sends the busy forth, each man to his pursuit: delay she knows not as she springs. 
O rich in opulence, after thy dawning birds that have flown forth no longer rest. 
This Dawn hath yoked her steeds afar, beyond the rising of the Sun: 
Borne on a hundred chariots she, auspicious Dawn, advances on her way to Men. 
To meet her glance all living creatures bend them down: Excellent One, she makes the light. 
Usas, the Daughter of the Sky, the opulent, shines foes and enmities away. 
Shine on us with thy radiant light, O Usas, Daughter of the Sky, 
Bringing to us great store of high felicity, and beaming on our solemn rites. 
For in thee is each living creature's breath and life, when, Excellent! thou dawnest forth. 
Borne on thy lofty car, O Lady of the Light, hear, thou of wondrous wealth, our call. 
llO Usas, win thyself the strength which among men is wonderful. 
Bring thou thereby the pious unto holy rites, those who as priests sing praise to thee. 
Bring from the firmament, O Usas, all the Gods, that they may drink our Soma juice, 
And, being what thou art, vouchsafe us kine and steeds, strength meet for praist and hero might. 
May Usas whose auspicious rays are seen resplendent round about, 
Grant us great riches, fair in form, of all good things, wealth which light labour may attain. 
Mighty One, whom the Rsis of old time invoked for their protection and their help, 
O Usas, graciously answer our songs of praise with bounty and with brilliant 
light. 
Usas, as thou with light to day hast opened the twin doors of heaven, 
So grant thou us a dwelling wide and free from foes. O Goddess, give us food with kine. 
Bring us to wealth abundant, sent in every shape, to plentiful refreshing food, 
To all-subduing splendour, Usas, Mighty One, to strength, thou rich in spoil and wealth. 
E'EN from above the sky's bright realm come, Usas, by auspicious ways: 
Let red steeds bear thee to the house of him who pours the Soma, juice. 
The chariot which thou mountest, fair of shape, O Usas light to move,- 
Therewith, O Daughter of the Sky, aid men of noble fame today. 
Bright Usas, when thy times return, all quadrupeds and bipeds stir, 
And round about flock winged birds from all theboundaries of heaven. 
Thou dawning with thy beams of light illumest all the radiant realm. 
Thee, as thou art, the Kanvas, fain for wealth, have called with sacred songs. 
HIS bright rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that lives, 
Surya, that all may look on him. 
The constellations pass away, like thieves, together with their beams. 
Before the all-beholding Sun' 
His herald rays are seen afar refulgent o'er the world of men, 
Like flames of fire that burn and blaze. 
Swift and all beautiful art thou, O Surya, maker of the light, 
Illuming all the radiant realm. 
Thou goest to the hosts of Gods, thou comest hither to mankind, 
Hither all light to be belield. 
With that same eye of thine wherewith thou lookest brilliant Varuna, 
Upon the busy race of men, 
Traversing sky and wide mid-air, thou metest with thy beams our days, 
Sun, seeing all things that have birth. 
Seven Bay Steeds harnessed to thy car bear thee, O thou farseeing One, 
God, Surya, with the radiant hair. 
Surya hath yoked the pure bright Seven, the daughters of the car; with these, 
His own dear team, he goeth forth. 
Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come 
To Surya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent. 
Rising this day, O rich in friends, ascending to the loftier heaven, 
Surya remove my heart's disease, take from me this my yellow hue. 
To parrots and to starlings let us give away my yellowness, 
Or this my yellowness let us transfer to Haritala trees. 
With all his conquering vigour this Aditya hath gone up on high. 
Giving my foe into mine hand: let me not be my foeman's prey. 
MAKE glad with songs that Ram whom many men invoke, worthy of songs of praise, Indra, the sea of 
wealth; 
Whose gracious deeds for men spread like the heavens abroad: sing praise to him the Sage, most liberal for 
our good. 
As aids the skilful Rbhus yearned to Indra strong to save, who fills mid-air, encompassed round with 
might. 
Rushing in rapture; and -o'er Satakratu came the gladdening shout that urged him on to victory. 
Thou hast disclosed the kine's stall for the Angirases, and made a way for Atri by a hundred doors. 
On Vimada thou hast bestowed both food and wealth, making thy bolt dance in the sacrificer's fight. 
Thou hast unclosed the prisons of the waters; thou hast in the mountain seized the treasure rich in gifts. 
When thou hadst slain with might the dragon Vrtra, thou. Indr a, didst raise the Sun in heaven for all to see 
With wondrous might thou blewest enchanter fiends away, with powers celestial those who called on thee 
in jest. 
Thou, hero-hearted, hast broken down Pipru's forts, and helped Rjisvan when the Dasyus were struck dea 
d. 
Thou savedst Kutsa when Susna was smitten down; to Atithigva gavest Sambara for a prey. 
E'en mighty Arbuda thou troddest under foot: thou from of old wast born to strike the Dasyus dead. 
All power and might is closely gathered up in thee; thy bounteous spirit joys in drinking Soma juice. 
Known is the thunderbolt that lies within thine arms: rend off therewith all manly prowess of our foe. 
Discern thou well Ary as and Dasyus; punishing the lawless give them up to him whose grass is strewn. 
Be thou the sacrificer's strong encourager all these thy deeds are my delight at festivals. 
Indra gives up the lawless to the pious man, destroying by the Strong Ones those who have no strength. 
en. 
The might which Usana hath formed for thee with might rends in its greatness and with strength both 
worlds apart. 
O Hero-souled, the steeds of Vata, yoked by thought, have carried thee to fame while thou art filled with 
power. 
When Indra hath rejoiced with Kavya Usana, he mounts his steeds who swerve wider and wider yet. 
The Strong hath loosed his bolt with the swift rush of rain, and he hath rent in pieces Susna's firm-built fo 
rts. 
Thou mountest on thy car amid strong Soma draughts: Saryata brought thee those in which thou hast 
delight. 
Indra, when thou art pleased with men whose Soma flows thou risest to unchallenged glory in the sky. 
To old Kaksivin, Soma-presser, skilled in song, O Indra, thou didst give the youthful Vrcaya. 
Thou, very wise, wast Mena, Vrsanaiva's child: those deeds of thine must all be told at Soma feasts. 
The good man's refuge in his need is Indra, firm as a doorpost, praised among the Pajras. 
Indra alone is Lord of wealth, the Giver, lover of riches, chariots, kine, and horses. 
To him the Mighty One, the self-resplendent, verily strong and great, this praise is uttered. 
May we and all the heroes, with the princes, be, in this fray, O Indra, in thy keeping. 
im. With hymns may I turn hither Indra to mine aid,-the Car which like a strong steed hasteth to the call. 
Like as a mountain on firm basis, unremoved, he, thousandfold protector, waxed in mighty strength, Wh 
en Indra, joying in the draughts of Soma juice, forced the clouds, slaying Vrtra stayer of their flow. 3 For 
he stays e'en the stayers, spread o'er laden cloud, rooted in light, strengthened in rapture by the wise. Indra 
with thought, with skilled activity, I call, most liberal giver, for he sates him with the juice. 4 Whom thos 
e that flow in heaven on sacred grass, his own assistants, nobly-natured, fill full like the sea,- Beside that 
Indra when he smote down Vrtra stood his helpers, straight in form, mighty, invincible. 
To him, as in wild joy he fought with him who stayed the rain, his helpers sped like swift streams downa 
slope. 
When Indra, thunder-armed, made bold by Soma draughts, as Trta cleaveth Vala's fences, cleft him throu 
gh- 
Splendour encompassed thee, forth shone thy warrior might: the rain-obstructer lay in mid-air's lowest 
deep, 
What time, O Indra, thou didst cast thy thunder down upon the jaws of Vritra hard to be restrained. 
The hymns which magnify thee, Indra, reach to thee even as water-brooks flow down and fill the lake. 
Tvastar gave yet more force to thine appropriate strength, and forged thy thunderbolt of overpowering mi 
ght. 
When, Indra, thou whose power is linked with thy Bay Steeds hadst smitten Vrtra, causing floods to flow 
for man. 
Thou heldst in thine arms the metal thunderbolt, and settest in the heaven the Sun for all to see. 
In fear they raised the lofty self-resplendent hymn, praise giving and effectual, leading up to heaven, 
When Indra's helpers fighting for the good of men, the Maruts, faithful to mankind, joyed in the light. 
Then Heaven himself, the mighty, at that Dragon's roar reeled back in terror when, Indra, thy thunderbolt 
In the wild joy of Soma had struck off with might the head of Vrtra, tyrant of the earth and heaven. 
llO Indra, were this earth extended forth tenfold, and men who dwell therein multiplied day by day, 
Still here thy conquering might, Maghavan, would be famed: it hath waxed vast as heaven in majesty and 
power. 
Thou, bold of heart, in thine own native might, for help, upon the limit of this mid-air and of heaven, 
Hast made the earth to be the pattern of thy strength: embracing flood and light thou reachest to the sky. 
Thou art the counterpart of earth, the Master of lofty heaven with all its mighty Heroes: 
Thou hast filled all the region with thy greatness: yea, of a truth there is none other like thee. 
Whose amplitude the heaven and earth have not attained, whose bounds the waters of mid-air have never 
reached, - 
Not, when in joy he fights the stayer of the rain: thou, and none else, hast made all things in order due. 
The Maruts sang thy praise in this encounter, and in thee all the Deities delighted, 
What time thou, Indra, with thy spiky weapon, thy deadly bolt, smotest the face of Vrtra. 
WE will present fair praise unto the Mighty One, our hymns to Indra in Vivasvdn's dwelling-place; 
For he hath ne'er found wealth in those who seem to sleep: those who give wealth to men accept no paltry 
praise. 
Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art Lord and guard of wealth: 
Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of our friends, to thee ,as such we sing this prais 
e. 
Indra, most splendid, powerful, rich in mighty deeds, this treasure spread around is known to be thine o 
wn. 
Gather therefrom, O Conqueror, and bring to us: fail not the hope of him who loves and sings to thee. 
Well pleased with these bright flames and with these Soma drops, take thou away our poverty with seeds 
and kine. 
With Indra scattering the Dasyu through these drops, freed from their hate may we obtain abundant food. 
Let us obtain, O Indra, plenteous wealth and food, with strength exceeding glorious, shining to the sky: 
May we obtain the Goddess Providence, the strength of heroes, special source of cattle, rich in steeds. 
These our libations strength-inspiring, Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vrtra, Hero Lor 
d, 
What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vrtras, thou resistless in thy might 
Thou goest on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle after castle here with strength. 
Thou. Indra, with thy friend who makes the foe bow down, slewest from far away the guileful Namuci. 
Thou hast struck down in death Karanja, Parnaya, in Atithigva's very glorious going forth. 
Unyielding, when Rjisvan compassed them with siege, thou hast destroyed the hundred forts of Vangrida. 
With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of 
men, 
With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Susravas. 
Thou hast protected Susravas with succour, and Turvayana with thine aid, O Indra 
. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Ayu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty. 
May we protected by the Gods hereafter remain thy very prosperous friends, O In 
dra. Thee we extol, enjoying through thy favour life long and joyful and with store of 
heroes. 
URGE us not, Maghavan, to this distressful fight, for none may comprehend the limit of thy strength. 
Thou with fierce shout hast made the woods and rivers roar: did not men run in crowds together in their fe 
ar? 
Sing hymns of praise to Sakra, Lord of power and might; laud thou and magnify Indra who hearcth thee 
» 
Who with his daring might, a Bull exceeding strong in strength, maketh him master of the heaven and eart 
h. 
Sing forth to lofty Dyaus a strength-bestowing song, the Bold, whose resolute mind hath independent 
sway. 
High glory hath the Asura, compact of strength, drawn on by two Bay Steeds: a Bull, a Car is he. 
The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of thyself smotest through Sambara, 
When bold with gladdening juice, thou warredst with thy bolt, shaip and twoedged, against the banded 
sorcerers. 
When with a roar that fills the woods, thou forcest down on wind's head the stores which 8usga kept 
confined, 
Who shall have power to stay thee firm and eager-souled from doing still this day what thou of old hast 
done? 
Thou helpest Narya, Turvasa, and Yadu, and Vayya's son Turviti, Satakratu! 
Thou helpest horse and car in final battle thou breakest down the nine-and-ninety castles. 
A hero-lord is he, King of a mighty folk, who offers free oblations and promotes the Law, 
Who with a bounteous guerdon welcomes hymns of praise: for him flows down the abundant stream below 
the sky. 
His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their work, be some who drink the Som 
a, 
Those, Indra, who increase the lordly power, the firm heroic strength of thee the Giver. 
Therefore for thee are these abundant beakers Indra's drink, stone-pressed juices held in ladles. 
Quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing; then fix thy mind upon bestowing treasure. 
There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters' flow: in Vrtra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay 
concealed. 
But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivities. 
So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people. 
Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring. 
THOUGH e'en this heaven's wide space and earth have spread them out, nor heaven nor earth may be in 
greatness Indra's match. 
Awful and very mighty, causing woe to men, he whets his thunderbolt for sharpness, as a bull. 
Like as the watery ocean, so doth he receive the rivers spread on all sides in their ample width. 
He bears him like a bull to drink of Soma juice, and will, as Warrior from of old, be praised for might. 
Thou swayest, Indra, all kinds of great manly power, so as to bend, as't were, even that famed mountain 
down. 
Foremost among the Gods is he through hero might, set in the van, the Strong One, for each arduous deed 
He only in the wood is praised by worshippers, when he shows forth to men his own fair Indra-power. 
A friendly Bull is he, a Bull to be desired when Maghavan auspiciously sends forth his voice. 
Yet verily the Warrior in his vigorous strength stirreth up with his might great battles for mankind; 
And men have faith in Indra, the resplendent One, what time he hurleth down his bolt, his dart of death. 
Though, fain for glory, and with strength increased on earth, he with great might destroys the dwellings 
made with art, 
He makes the lights of heaven shine forth secure, he bids, exceeding wise, the floods flow for his worship 
per. 
Drinker of Soma, let thy heart incline to give; bring thy Bays hitherward, O thou who hearest praise. 
Those charioteers of thine, best skilled to draw the rein, the rapid sunbeams, Indra, lead thee not astray. 
Thou bearest in both hands treasure that never fails; the famed One in his body holds un vanquished mig 
ht. 
O Indra, in thy members many powers abide, like wells surrounded by the ministering priests. 
FOR this man's full libations held in ladles, he hath roused him, eager, as a horse to meet the mare. 
He stays his golden car, yoked with Bay Horses, swift, and drinks the Soma juice which strengthens for great 
deeds. 
To him the guidance-following songs of praise flow full, as those who seek gain go in company to the 
flood. 
To him the Lord of power, the holy synod's might, as to a hill, with speed, ascend the loving ones. 
Wherewith the iron one, fierce e'en against the strong, in rapture, fettered wily Sushna fast in bonds. 
When Strength the Goddess, made more strong for help by thee, waits upon Indra as the Sun attends the 
Dawn, 
Then, he who with his might unflinching kills the gloom stirs up the dust aloft, with joy and triumphing. 
When thou with might, upon the framework of the heaven, didst fix, across, air's region firmly, unremo 
ved, 
In the light-winning war, Indra, in rapturous joy, thou smotest Vrtra dead and broughtest floods of rain. 
Thou with thy might didst grasp, the holder-up of heaven, thou who art mighty also in the seats of earth. 
Thou, gladdened by the juice, hast set the waters free, and broken Vrtra's stony fences through and throug 
h. 
To him most liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful and strong, I bring my hymn,- 
Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread abroad for all that live, to give them strengt 
h. 
Now all this world, for worship, shall come after thee-the offerer's libations like floods to the depth. 
When the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thunderbolt of Indra, shatterer wrought of gold. 
To him the terrible, most meet for lofty praise, like bright Dawn, now bring gifts with reverence in this r 
ite, 
Whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been created, like bay steeds, to move with 
speed. 
Thine, Indra, praised by many, excellently rich! are we who trusting in thy help draw near to thee. 
Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as earth loves all her creatures, love thou this our hy 
mn. 
Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan, the wish of this thy worshipper. 
After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength: to thee and to thy power this earth hath bowed itsel 
f. 
Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast shattered into pieces this broad massive clou 
d. 
Thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow: thou hast, thine own for ever, all victorious 
might. 
NE'ER waxeth faint the Immortal, Son of Strength, since he, the Herald, hath become Vivasvan's 
messenger. 
On paths most excellent he measured out mid-air: he with oblation calls to service of the Gods. 
Never decaying, seizing his appropriate food, rapidly, eagerly through the dry wood he spreads. 
His back, as he is sprinkled, glistens like a horse: loud hath he roared and shouted like the heights of heav 
en? 
Set high in place o'er all that Vasus, Rudras do, immortal, Lord of riches, seated as High Priest; 
Hastening like a car to men, to those who live, the God without delay gives boons to be desired. 
Urged by the wind be spreads through dry wood as he lists, armed with his tongues for sickles, with a 
mighty roar. 
Black is thy path, Agni, changeless, with glittering waves! when like a bull thou rushest eager to the trees. 
With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds, triumphant like a bull among the herd of 
cows, 
With bright strength roaming to the everlasting air: things fixed, things moving quake before him as he fli 
es. 
The Bhrgus established thee among mankind for men, like as a treasure, beauteous, easy to invoke; 
Thee, Agni, as a herald and choice-worthy guest, as an auspicious Friend to the Celestial Race. 
Agni, the seven tongues' deftest Sacrificer, him whom the priests elect at solemn worship. 
The Herald, messenger of all the Vasus, I serve with dainty food, I ask for riches. 
Grant, Son of Strength, thou rich in friends, a refuge without a flaw this day to us thy praisers. 
O Agni, Son of Strength, with forts of iron preserve thou from distress the man who lauds thee. 
Be thou a refuge, Bright One, to the singer, a shelter. Bounteous Lord, to those who worship. 
Preserve the singer from distress, O Agni. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. 
THE other fires are, verily, thy branches; the Immortals all rejoice in thee, O Agni. 
Centre art thou, Vaigvdnara, of the people, sustaining men like a deep-founded pillar. 
The forehead of the sky, earth's centre, Agni became the messenger of earth and heaven. 
As in the Sun firm rays are set for ever, treasures are in Vaisvanara, in Agni. 
Of all the riches in the hills, the waters, the herbs, among mankind, thou art the Sovran. 
As the great World-halves, so are their Son's praises; skilled, as a man, to act, is he the Herald. 
Even the lofty heaven, O Jatavedas Vaisvanara, hath not attained thy greatness. 
Thou art the King of lands where men are settled, thou hast brought comfort to the Gods in battle. 
Now will I tell the greatness of the Hero whom Prarti's sons follow as Vrtra's slayer: 
Agni Vaisvanara struck down the Dasyu, cleave Sambara through and shattered down his fences. 
Is lauded, excellent, with hundred praises by Purunitha, son of Satavani. 
As 'twere Some goodly treasure Matarisvan brought, as a gift, the glorious Priest to Bhrgu, 
Banner of sacrifice, the good Protector, child of two births, the swiftly moving envoy. 
Both Gods and men obey this Ruler's order, Gods who are worshipped, men who yearn and worship. 
As Priest he takes his seat ere break of morning, House-Lord, adorable with men, Ordainer. 
May our fair praise, heart-bom, most recent, reach him whose tongue, e'en at his birth, is sweet as hone 
y; 
Whom mortal priests, men, with their strong endeavour, supplied with dainty viands, have created. 
Good to mankind, the yearning Purifier hath among men been placed as Priest choice-worthy. 
May Agni be our Friend, Lord of the Household, protector of the riches in the dwelling. 
As such we Gotamas with hymns extol thee, O Agni, as the guardian Lord of riches, 
Decking thee like a horse, the swift prizewinner. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. 
EVEN to him, swift, strong and high, exalted, 1 bring my song of praise as dainty viands, 
My thought to him resistless, praise-deserving, prayers offered most especially to Indra. 
Praise, like oblation, 1 present, and utter aloud my song, my fair hymn to the Victor. 
For Indra, who is Lord of old, the singers have decked their lauds with heart and mind and spirit. 
To him then with my lips mine adoration, winning heaven's light, most excellent, I offer, 
To magnify with songs of invocation and with fair hymns the Lord, most bounteous Giver. 
Even for him I frame a laud, as fashions the wright a chariot for the man who needs it, — 
Praises to him who gladly hears our praises, a hymn well-formed, all-moving, to wise Indra. 
So with my tongue I deck, to please that Indra, my hymn, as 'twere a horse, through love of glory, 
To reverence the Hero, bounteous Giver, famed far and wide, destroyer of the castles. 
Even for him hath Tvastar forged the thunder, most deftly wrought, celestial, for the battle, 
Wherewith he reached the vital parts of Vrtra, striking-the vast, the mighty with the striker. 
As soon as, at libations of his mother, great Visnu had drunk up the draught, he plundered. 
The dainty cates, the cooked mess; but One stronger transfixed the wild boar, shooting through the mount 
ain. 
To him, to Indra, when he slew the Dragon, the Dames, too. Consorts of the Goda, wove praises. 
The mighty heaven and earth hath he encompassed: thy greatness heaven and earth, combined, exceed not 
Yea, of a truth, his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of earth, mid-air, and heaven. 
Indra, approved by all men, self-resplendent, waxed in his home, loud-voiced and strong for battle. 
Through his own strength Indra with bolt of thunder cut piece-meal Vrtra, drier up of waters. 
He let the floods go free, like cows imprisoned, for glory, with a heart inclined to bounty. 
The rivers played, through his impetuous splendour, since with his bolt he compassed them on all sides 
Using his might and favouring him who worshipped, he made a ford, victorious, for Turviti. 
Rend thou his joints, as of an ox, dissevered, with bolt oblique, that floods of rain may follow. 
Sing with new lauds his exploits wrought aforetime, the deeds of him, yea, him who moveth swiftly, 
When, hurling forth his weapons in the battle, he with impetuous wrath lays low the foemen. 
When he, yea, he, comes forth the firm. Set mountains and the whole heaven and earth, tremble for terr 
or. 
May Nodhas, ever praising the protection of that dear Friend, gain quickly strength heroic. 
Now unto him of these things hath been given what he who rules alone o'er much, electeth. 
Indra hath helped Etasa, Soma-presser, contending in the race of steeds with Sarya. 
Thus to thee, Indra, yoker of Bay Coursers, the Gotamas have brought their prayers to please thee. 
Bestow upon them thought, decked with all beauty. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. 
. LIKE Angiras a gladdening laud we ponder to him who loveth song, exceeding mighty. 
Let us sing glory to the far-famed Hero who must be praised with fair hymns by the singer. 
Unto the great bring ye great adoration, a chant with praise to him exceeding mighty, 
Through whom our sires, Angirases, singing praises and knowing well the places, found the cattle. 
When Indra and the Angirases desired it, Sarama found provision for her offipring. 
Brhaspati cleft the mountain, found the cattle: the heroes shouted with the kine in triumph. 
Mid shout, loud shout, and roar, with the Navagvas, seven singers, hast thou, heavenly, rent the mountai 
n; 
Thou hast, with speeders, with Dasagvas, Indra, Sakra, with thunder rent obstructive Vala. 
Praised by Angirases, thou, foe-destroyer, hast, with the Dawn, Sun, rays, dispelled the darkness. 
Thou Indra, hast spread out the earths high ridges, and firmly fixed the region under heaven. 
This is the deed most worthy of all honour, the fairest marvel of the Wonder-Worker, 
That, nigh where heaven bends down, he made four rivers flow full with waves that carry down sweet wat 
er. 
Unwearied, won with lauding hymns, he parted of old the ancient Pair, united ever. 
In highest sky like Bhaga, he the doer of marvels set both Dames and earth and heaven. 
Still born afresh, young Dames, each in her manner, unlike in hue, the Pair in alternation 
Round heaven and earth from ancient time have travelled, Night with her dark limbs, Dawn with limbs of 
splendour. 
Rich in good actions, skilled in operation, the Son with might maintains his perfect friendship. 
Thou in the raw cows, black of hue or ruddy, storest the ripe milk glossy white in colour. 
Their paths, of old connected, rest uninjured; they with great might preserve the immortal statutes. 
For many thousand holy works the Sisters wait on the haughty Lord like wives and matrons. 
Thoughts ancient, seeking wealth, with adoration, with newest lauds have sped to thee, O Mighty. 
As yearning wives cleave to their yearning husband, so cleave our hymns to thee, O Lord most potent. 
Strong God, the riches which thy hands have holden from days of old have perished not nor wasted. 
Splendid art thou, O Indra, wise, unbending: strengthen us with might, O Lord of Power. 
mighty Indra, Gotama's son Nodhas hath fashioned this new prayer to thee Eternal, 
Sure leader, yoker of the Tawny Coursers. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. 
THOU art the Mighty One; when born, O Indra, with power thou tcrrifiedst earth and heaven - 
When, in their fear of thee, all firm-set mountains and monstrous creatures shook like dust before thee. 
When thy two wandering Bays thou drawest hither, thy praiser laid within thine arms the thunder, 
Wherewith, O Much-invoked, in will resistless, thou smitest foemen down and many a castle. 
Faithful art thou, these thou defiest, Indra; thou art the Rbhus' Lord, heroic, victor. 
Thou, by his side, for young and glorious Kutsa, with steed and car in battle slewest Susna, 
That, as a friend, thou furtheredst, O Indra, when, Thunderer, -strong in act, thou crushedst Vrtra; 
When, Hero, thou, great-souled, with easy conquest didst rend the Dasyus in their 
distant dwelling. 
This doest thou, and art not harmed, O Indra, e'en in the anger of the strongest mortal. 
Lay thou the race-course open for our horses: as with a club, slay, Thunderarmed 1 our foemen. 
Hence men invoke thee, Indra, in the tumult of battle, in the light-bestowing conflict. 
This aid of thine, O Godlike One, was ever to be implored in deeds of might in combat. 
Warring for Purukutsa thou, O Indra, Thunder-armed I breakest down the seven castles; 
Easily, for Sudis, like grass didst rend them, and out of need, King, broughtest gain to Puru. 
O Indra, God who movest round about us, feed us with varied food plenteous as water- 
Food wherewithal, O Hero, thou bestowest vigour itself to flow to us for ever. 
Prayers have been made by Gotamas, O Indra, addressed to thee, with laud for thy Bay Horses. 
Bring us in noble shape abundant riches. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. 
. BRING for the manly host, wise and majestical, 0 Nodhas, for the Maruts bring thou a pure gift. 
deck my songs as one deft-handed, wise in mind prepares the water that hath power in solemn rites. 
They spring to birth, the lofty Ones, the Bulls of Heaven, divine, the youths of Rudra, free from spot and 
stain; 
The purifiers, shining brightly even as suns, awful of form like giants, scattering rain-drops down. 
Young Rudras, demon-slayers, never growing old, they have waxed, even as mountains, irresistible. 
They make all beings tremble with their mighty strength, even the very strongest, both of earth and heave 
n. 
With glittering ornaments they deck them forth for show; for beauty on their breasts they bind their chains 
of gold. 
The lances on their shoulders pound to pieces; they were born together, of themselves, the Men of Heaven 
Loud roarers, giving strength, devourers of the foe, they make the winds, they make the lightnings with 
their powers. 
The restless shakers drain the udders of the sky, and ever wandering round fill the earth full with milk. 
The bounteous Maruts with the fatness dropping milk fill full the waters which avail in solenm rites. 
They lead, as 'twere, the Strong Horse forth, that it may rain: they milk the thundering, the never-failing 
spring. 
Mighty, with wondrous power and marvellously bright, selfstrong like mountains, ye glide swiftly on your 
way. 
Like the wild elephants ye eat the forests up when ye assume your strength among the bright red flames. 
Exceeding wise they roar like lions mightily, they, all-possessing, are beauteous as antelopes; 
Stirring the darkness with lances and spotted deer, combined as priests, with serpents' fury through their 
might. 
Heroes who march in companies, befriending man, with serpents' ire through strength, ye greet the earth 
and heaven. 
Upon the seats, O Maruts, of your chariots, upon the cars stands lightning visible as light. 
Lords of all riches, dwelling in the home of wealth, endowed with mighty vigour, singers loud of voice 
Heroes, of powers infinite, armed with strong men’s rings, the archers, they have laid the arrow on their ar 
ms. 
They who with golden fellies make the rain increase drive forward the big clouds like wanderers on the 
way. 
Self-moving, brisk, unwearied, they o'erthrow the firm; the Maruts with bright lances make all things to r 
eel. 
The progeny of Rudra we invoke with prayer, the brisk, the bright, the worshipful, the active Ones 
To the strong band of Maruts cleave for happiness, the chasers of the sky, impetuous, vigorous. 
Maruts, the man whom ye have guarded with your help, he verily in strength surpasseth all mankind. 
Spoil with his steeds he gaineth, treasure with his men; he winneth honourable strength and prospereth. 
O Maruts, to the worshippers give glorious strength invincible in battle, brilliant, bringing wealth. 
Praiseworthy, known to all men. May we foster well, during a hundred winters, son and progeny. 
Will ye then, O ye Maruts, grant us riches, durable, rich in men, defying onslaught. 
A hundred, thousandfold, ever increasing? May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. 
ONE-MINDED, wise, they tracked thee like a thief lurking in dark cave with a stolen cow: 
Thee claiming worship, bearing it to Gods there nigh to thee sate all the Holy Ones. 
The Gods approached the ways of holy Law; there was a gathering vast as heaven itself. 
The waters feed with praise the growing Babe, born nobly in the womb, the seat of Law. 
Like grateful food, like some wide dwelling place, like a fruit-bearing hill, a wholesome stream. 
Like a steed urged to run in swift career, rushing like Sindhu, who may check his course? 
Kin as a brother to his sister floods, he cats the woods as a King eats the rich. 
When through the forest, urged by wind, he spreads, verily Agni shears the hair of earth. 
Like a swan sitting in the floods he pants wisest in mind mid men he wakes at morn. 
A Sage like Soma, sprung from Law, he grew like some young creature, mighty, shining far. 
. LIKE the Sun's glance, like wealth of varied sort, like breath which is the life, like one's own son, 
Like a swift bird, a cow who yields her milk, pure and refulgent to the wood he speeds. 
He offers safety like a pleasant home, like ripened corn, the Conqueror of men. 
Like a Seer lauding, famed among the folk; like a steed friendly he vouchsafes us power. 
With flame insatiate, like eternal might; caring for each one like a dame at home; 
Bright when he shines forth, whitish mid the folk, like a car, gold-decked, thundering to the fight. 
He strikes with terror like a dart shot forth, e'en like an archer's arrow tipped with flame; 
Master of present and of future life, the maidens' lover and the matrons' Lord. 
To him lead all your ways: may we attain the kindled God as cows their home at eve. 
He drives the flames below as floods their swell: the rays rise up to the fair place of heaven. 
Gracious like peace, blessing like mental power, Priest was he, offering-bearer, full of thought. 
He, bearing in his hand all manly might, crouched in the cavern, struck the Gods with fear. 
Men filled with understanding find him there, when they have sting prayers formed within their heart. 
He, like the Unborn, holds the broad earth up; and with effective utterance fixed the sky. 
O Agni, guard the spots which cattle love: thou, life of all, hast gone from lair to lair. 
Whoso hath known him dwelling in his lair, and hath approached the stream of holy Law,- 
They who release him, paying sacred rites, -truly to such doth he announce great wealth. 
He who grows mightily in herbs, within each fruitful mother and each babe she bears, 
Wise, life of all men, in the waters' home, -for him have sages built as 'twere a seat. 
COMMINGLING, restless, he ascends the sky, unveiling nights and all that stands or moves, 
As he the sole God is preeminent in great, ness among all these other Gods. 
All men are joyful in thy power, O God, that living from the dry wood thou art born. 
All truly share thy Godhead while they keep, in their accustomed ways, eternal Law. 
Strong is the thought of Law, the Law's behest; all works have they performed; he quickens all. 
Whoso will bring oblation, gifts to thee, to him, bethinking thee, vouchsafe thou wealth. 
Seated as Priest with Manu's progeny, of all these treasures he alone is Lord. 
Men yearn for children to prolong their line, and are not disappointed in their hope. 
Eagerly they who hear his word fulfil his wish as sons obey their sire's behest. 
He, rich in food, unbars his wealth like doors: he, the House-Friend, bath decked heaven's vault with stars 
. BRIGHT, splendid, like Dawn's lover, he bath filled the two joined worlds as with the light of heaven. 
When born, with might thou hast encompassed them: Father of Gods, and yet their Son wast thou. 
Agni, the Sage, the humble, who discerns like the cow's udder, the sweet taste of food, 
Like a bliss-giver to be drawn to men, sits gracious in the middle of the house. 
Born in the dwelling like a lovely son, pleased, like a strong steed, he bears on the folk. 
What time the men and I, with heroes, call, may Agni then gain all through Godlike power. 
None breaks these holy laws of thine when thou hast granted audience to these chieftains here. 
This is thy boast, thou smotest with thy peers, and joined with heroes dravest off disgrace. 
Like the Dawn's lover, spreading light, well-known as hued like morn, may he remember me. 
They, bearing of themselves, unbar the doors: they all ascend to the fair place of heaven. 
. MAY we, the pious, win much food by prayer, may Agni with fair light pervade each act,- 
He the observer of the heavenly laws of Gods, and of the race of mortal man. 
He who is germ of waters, germ of woods, germ of all things that move not and that move,- 
To him even in the rock and in the house: Immortal One, he cares for all mankind. 
Agni is Lord of riches for the man who serves him readily with sacred songs. 
Protect these beings thou with careful thought, knowing the races both of Gods and men. 
Whom many dawns and nights, unlike, make strong, whom, born in Law, all things that move and stand 
He bath been won, Herald who sits in light, making effectual all our holy works. 
Thou settest value on our cows and woods: all shall bring tribute to us to the light. 
men have served thee in many and sundry spots, parting, as 'twere, an aged father's wealth. 
Like a brave archer, like one skilled and bold, a fierce avenger, so he shines in fight. 
. LOVING the loving One, as wives their husband, the sisters of one home have urged him forward, 
Bright-coloured, even, as the cows love morning, dark, breaking forth to view, and redly beaming. 
Our sires with lauds burst e'en the firmset fortress, yea, the Angirases, with roar, the mountain. 
They made for us a way to reach high heaven, they found us day, light, day's sign, beams of morning. 
They stablished order, made his service fruitful; then parting them among the longing faithful, 
Not thirsting after aught, they come, most active, while with sweet food the race of Gods they strengthen. 
Since Matarisvan, far-diffused, bath stirred him, and he in every house grown bright and noble, 
He, Bhrgu-like I hath gone as his companion, as on commission to a greater Sovran. 
When man poured juice to Heaven, the mighty Father, he knew and freed himself from close embracem 
ent. 
The archer boldly shot at him his arrow, and the God threw his splendour on his Daughter. 
Whoso, bath flames for thee within his dwelling, or brings the worship which thou lovest daily, 
Do thou of double might increase his substance: may he whom thou incitest meet with riches. 
All sacrificial viands wait on Agni as the Seven mighty Rivers seek the ocean. 
Not by our brethren was our food discovered: find with the Gods care for us, thou who knowest. 
When light bath filled the Lord of men for increase, straight from the heaven descends the limpid moist 
ure. 
Agni bath brought to light and filled with spirit the youthful host blameless and well providing. 
He who like thought goes swiftly on his journey, the Sun, alone is ever Lord of riches. 
The Kings with fair hands, Varuna and Mitra, protect the precious nectar in our cattle. 
O Agni, break not our ancestral friendship. Sage as thou art, endowed with deepest knowledge. 
Old age, like gathering cloud, impairs the body: before that evil be come nigh protect me. 
. THOUGH holding many gifts for men, he humbleth the higher powers of each wise ordainer. 
Agni is now the treasure-lord of treasures, for ever granting all immortal bounties. 
The Gods infallible all searching found not him, the dear Babe who still is round about us. 
Worn weary, following his track, devoted, they reached the lovely highest home of Agni. 
Because with holy oil the pure Ones, Agni, served thee the very pure three autumn seasons, 
Therefore they won them holy names for worship, and nobly born they dignified their bodies. 
Making them known to spacious earth and heaven, the holy Ones revealed the powers of Rudra. 
The mortal band, discerning in the distance, found Agni standing in the loftiest station. 
Nigh they approached, one-minded, with their spouses, kneeling to him adorable paid worship. 
Friend finding in his own friend's eye protection, they made their own the bodies which they chastened. 
Soon as the holy beings had discovered the thrice-seven mystic things contained within thee, 
With these, one-minded., they preserve the Amrta: guard thou the life of all their plants and cattle. 
Thou, Agni, knower of men's works, hast sent us good food in constant course for our subsistence: 
Thou deeply skilled in paths of Gods becamest an envoy never wearied, offeringbearer. 
Knowing the Law, the seven strong floods from heaven, full of good thought, discerned the doors of ric 
hes. 
Sarama found the cattle's firm-built prison whereby the race of man is still supported. 
They who approached all noble operations making a path that leads to life immortal, 
To be the Bird's support, the spacious mother, Aditi, and her great Sons stood in power. 
When Gods immortal made both eyes of heaven, they gave to him the gift of beauteous glory. No 
w they flow forth like rivers set in motion: they knew the Red Steeds coming down, O Agni. 
I. HE who gives food, like patrimonial riches and guides aright like some wise man's instruction, 
Loved like a guest who lies in pleasant lodging, -may he, as Priest, prosper his servant's dwelling. 
He who like Savitar the God, true-minded protecteth with his power, all acts of vigour, 
Truthful, like splendourr, glorified by many, like breath joy-giving, -all must strive to win him. 
He who on earth dwells like a king surrounded by faithful friends, like a God all-sustaining, 
Like heroes who preside, who sit in safety: like as a blameless dame dear to her husband. 
Thee, such, in settlements secure, O Agni, our men serve ever kindled in each dwelling. 
On him have they laid splendour in abundance: dear to all men, bearer be he of riches. 
May thy rich worshippers win food, O Agni, and princes gain long life who bring oblation. 
May we get booty from jur foe in battle, presenting to the Gods their share for glory. 
The cows of holy law, sent us by Heaven, have swelled with laden udders, loudly lowing; 
Soliciting his favour, from a distance the rivers to the rock have flowed together. 
Agni, with thee, soliciting thy favour, the holy Ones have gained glory in heaven. 
They made the Night and Dawn of different colours, and set the black and purple hues together. 
May we and those who worship be the mortals whom thou, O Agni, leadest on to riches. 
Thou hast filled earth and heaven and air's mid-region, and followest the whole world like a shadow. 
Aided by thee, O Agni, may we conquer steeds with steeds, men with men, heroes with heroes, 
Lords of the wealth transmitted by our fathers: and may our princes live a hundred winters. 
May these our hymns of praise, Agni, Ordainer, be pleasant to thee in thy heart and spirit. 
May we have power to hold thy steeds of riches, laying on thee the God-sent gift of glory. 
. As forth to sacrifice we go, a hymn to a hymn let us say, Who hears us even when afar; 
Who, from of old, in carnage, when the people gathered, hath preserved 
His household for the worshipper. 
And let men say, Agni is born, e'en he who slayeth Vrtra, he 
Who winneth wealth in every fight. 
Him in whose house an envoy thou lovest to taste his offered gifts. 
And strengthenest his sacrifice, 
Him, Angiras, thou Son of Strength, all men call happy in his God, 
His offerings, and his sacred grass. 
Hitherward shalt thou bring these Gods to our laudation and to taste. 
These offered gifts, fair-shining One. 
When, Agni, on thine embassage thou goest not a sound is heard of steed or straining of thy car. 
Aided by thee uninjured, strong, one after other, goes he forth: 
Agni, the ofterer forward steps. 
And splendid strength, heroic, high, Agni, thou grantest from the Gods, 
Thou God, to him who offers gifts. 
. ACCEPT our loudest-sounding hymn, food most delightful to the Gods, Po 
uring our offerings in thy mouth. 
Now, Agni, will we say to thee, O wisest and best Afigiras, 
Our precious, much-availing prayer. 
Who, Agni, is thy kin, of men? who is thy worthy worshipper? 
On whom dependent? who art thou? 
The kinsman, Agni, of mankind, their well beloved Friend art thou, 
A Friend whom friends may supplicate. 
Bring to us Mitra, Varuna, bring the Gods to mighty sacrifice. 
Bring them, O Agni, to thine home. 
How may the mind draw nigh to please thee, Agni? What hymn of praise shall bring us greatest blessin 
g? 
Or who hath gained thy power by sacrifices? or with what mind shall we bring thee oblations? 
Come hither, Agni; sit thee down as Hotar; be thou who never wast deceived our leader. 
May Heaven and Earth, the all-pervading, love thee: worship the Gods to win for us their favour. 
Burn thou up all the Riksasas, O Agni; ward thou off curses from our sacrifices. 
Bring hither with his Bays the Lord of Soma: here is glad welcome for the Bounteous Giver. 
Thou Priest with lip and voice that bring us children hast been invoked. Here with the Gods be seated. 
Thine is the task of Cleanser and Presenter: waken us, Wealth-bestower and Producer. 
As with oblations of the priestly Manus thou worshippedst the Gods, a Sage with sages, 
So now, O truthfullest Invoker Agni, worship this day with joy-bestowing ladle. 
How shall we pay oblation unto Agni? What hymn, Godloved, is said to him refulgent? 
Who, deathless, true to Law, mid men a herald, bringeth the Gods as best of sacrificers? 
Bring him with reverence hither, most propitious in sacrifices, true to Law, the herald; 
For Agni, when he seeks the Gods for mortals, knows them full well and worships them in spirit. 
For he is mental power, a man, and perfect; he is the bringer, friend-, like, of the wondrous. 
The pious Aryan tribes at sacrifices address them first to him who doeth marvels. 
May Agni, foe-destroyer, manliest Hero, accept with love our hymns and our devotion. 
So may the liberal lords whose strength is strongest, urged by their riches, stir our thoughts with vigour. 
Thus Agni Jatavedas, true to Order, hath by the priestly Gotamas been lauded. 
May he augment in them splendour and vigour: observant, as he lists, he gathers increase. 
O JATAVEDAS, keen and swift, we Gotamas with sacred song exalt thee for thy glories' sake. 
Thee, as thou art, desiring wealth Gotama worships with his song: 
We laud thee for thy glories' sake. 
As such, like Angiras we call on thee best winner of the spoil: 
We laud thee for thy glories' sake. 
Thee, best of Vrtra-slayers, thee who shakest off our Dasyu foes: 
We laud thee for thy glories' sake. 
A pleasant song to Agni we, sons of Rahugana, have sung: 
We laud thee for thy glories' sake. 
HE in mid-air's expanse hath golden tresses; a raging serpent, like the rushing tempest: 
Purely refulgent, knowing well the morn, ing; like honourable dames, true, active workers. 
Thy well-winged flashes strengthen in their manner, when the black Bull hath bellowed round about us. 
With drops that bless and seem to smile he cometh: the waters fall, the clouds utter their thunder. 
When he comes streaming with the milk of worship, conducting by directest paths of Order 
Aryaman, Mitra, Varuna, Parijman fill the hide full where lies the nether press-stone. 
O Agni, thou who art the lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of Strength, 
He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our song: 
Shine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us. 
O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks, 
Burn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the Raksasas. 
Adorable in all our rites, favour us, Agni, with thine.aid, 
When the great hymn is chanted forth. 
Bring to us ever-conquering wealth, wealth, Agni, worthy of our choice, 
In all our frays invincible. 
Give us, O Agni, through thy grace wealth that supporteth all our life, 
Thy favour so that we may live. 
O Gotama, desiring bliss present thy songs composed with care 
To Agni of the pointed flames. 
May the man fall, O Agni, who near or afar assaileth us: 
Do thou increase and prosper us. 
Keen and swift Agni, thousand-eyed, chaseth the Raksasas afar: 
He singeth, herald meet for lauds. 
THUS in the Soma, in wild joy the Brahman hath exalted thee: Thou, mightiest It thunder-armed, hast 
driven by force he Dragon from the earth, lauding thine own imperial 
sway. 
The mighty flowing Soma-draught, brought by the Hawk, hath gladdened thee, 
That in thy strength, O Thunderer, thou hast struck down Vrtra from the floods, lauding thine own imperial 
sway. 
Go forward, meet the foe, be bold; thy bolt of thunder is not checked. 
Manliness, Indra, is thy might: stay Vrtra, make the waters thine, lauding thine own imperial sway. 
Thou smotest Vrtra from the earth, smotest him, Indra, from the sky. 
Let these life-fostering waters flow attended by the Marut host, lauding thine own imperial sway. 
The wrathful Indra with his bolt of thunder
