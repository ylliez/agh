<p id="1917"> (Note: Marclay makes a mistake) A scene from The Fortune Cookie (d. Billy Wilder, 1966): Luther &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Jackson (Ron Rich) exits an elevator on the 4th floor and approaches a nun behind a receiving desk at St. Marks Hospital (as shown in the previous scene not part of Maclay&#39;s clip.) He is carrying a bouquet of flowers. &quot;Mr. Hinkle&#39;s room, what&#39;s the number?&quot; he asks. The nun (Dodie Heath) says, &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s not visiting hours.&quot; A conversation ensues. In the background behind the desk there is a wall clock which shows that the conversation begins at 7:17 and lasts until almost 7:18. I entered the MOMA exhibition at 6:50 PM and saw this clip about 28 minutes later. The problem is that in the narrative of The Fortune Cookie, this conversation took place at 7:17 AM and not at 7:17 PM when it was shown in Marclay&#39;s movie. Watchers of The Fortune Cookie know that the scene takes place in the morning because in the ensuing scene (not shown by Marclay)&quot;Boom Boom&quot; knocks on Hinkles door and is shooed away by a nurse. At this Willie Gingrich (Walter Mathau) wakes up grumbling about the nerve of &quot;Boom Boom&quot; showing up at the hospital after what Boom Boom has done to Hinkle. Willie then wakes-up Harry Hinkle (Jack Lemmon) opens the blinds to let in the morning light and tells Hinkle &quot;good morning&quot;. </p>
