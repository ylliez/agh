### Statement
Reflections on Christian Marclay's *The Clock*, a 2010 looped 24-hour video supercut featuring timepieces the diagetic chronology of which corresponds to real-world time when the projection is synchronized. The piece has given rise to much commentary (e.g. [Russel, 2013](http://catherinerussell.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Russell-FW-54-2-Archival-Cinephilia-in-The-Clock.pdf)), of which one specific aspect - intellectual property rights - has drawn more widespread attention and it at the core of this piece.<br>
Briefly put, while Marclay's video art piece is a montage of appropriated clips from a variety of famous films, albeit drawn from a geographically and culturally restricted canon, it has remained elusive to pirating efforts; even attempts at crowdsourcing a reverse-engineered replica have failed to yield more than an unfinished document giving imperfect verbal descriptions of the scenes.<br>
The present piece is a response to this copyright hermeticism, the website serving as a sort of abstractly interactive and frivolously meta-archival elephant's graveyard for this document. The background invariably remains a schematic clock face; the hour hand displays the actual time. If a scene description exists in the document (laboriously converted to a JSON for the purposes of this piece) at the time, it will be presented in the minute hand. Otherwise, the clock will rewind until the closest available description, creating a layered palimpsest emphasizing the inaccessibility of the work. The process is repeated every minute, endlessly.<br><br>

### R&D

~~Attempt to pirate The Clock (an ongoing vendetta) to obtain individual sequences and recreate a frame by frame rendition of the piece using a CPU-breaking JSON file.~~ -> perpetually frustrated<br>
~~Attempt to use [crowdsource clock variant](https://theclockmarclay.wikia.com/wiki/Crowdsourcing-The-Clock)~~ -> presently defunct?<br>
~~Consider technical alternative? (e.g. [Human Clock project](https://humanclock.com/))~~ -> meh..<br>
~~Consider conceptual meta (e.g. associate access time with other info (e.g. wiki entry or bible verse?)~~ -> Ã¼ber-meh..<br>
Consider conceptual alternative (e.g. stretched, cf Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho) -> became Doigt Andalou<br>
Consider technic-conceptual alternative (e.g. [text-repo of The Clock](http://clockclock.ars.is/)) -> Clock Pyright<br>
Next -> format continually updated crowd-sourced version The Clock wiki's [Timeline](https://theclock.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline)
